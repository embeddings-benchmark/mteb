    "document": "\"I thought it was great, fantastic,\" says Tom, one of the 450 or so full-time workers who work shifts preparing and packaging chilled fish destined for the supermarket shelves.\nTom is not his real name. He's too scared of revealing his true identity for fear of losing his job.\nHis employer is about to impose new terms and conditions and the workers aren't happy.\n\"The workforce are up in arms about it. Everybody is really really annoyed with the company the way they've done things... we feel as though they're robbing us,\" he says.\nOn 1 April, the government increased the minimum wage from \u00a36.70 to \u00a37.20 an hour for workers aged 25 and over.\nSeachill relies on overtime to keep its conveyor belts running.  It's a requirement written into staff contracts.\nOn top of a 40-hour week, Tom says workers can end up doing another 20 hours, especially when there's a big order to complete.\nHis employer wants to increase the basic rate of pay to \u00a37.35 an hour but cut overtime payments..\nTom reckons he will earn up to \u00a380 a month less than he was expecting.\nWorkers have to decide whether to accept the new contracts or risk losing their jobs.\n\"Even with the new rate they've offered us at \u00a37.35 an hour, at time and a quarter, it's less than what they would've been paying us at \u00a37.20 an hour and time and a half and double time.\n\"We are losing out big style,\" he says.\nThe company is part of the Icelandic Group. It made more than \u00a38m in profit last year. In a statement, it says its changes are designed to make it more efficient and says most workers will be better off.\nTom disagrees and says he's 100% certain the changes are being made to help offset the costs of the new National Living Wage.\n\"It's not on. As far as all of us are concerned, it's not on. How can they say in one breath that the firm is doing really well, and then expect us to take a pay cut?\"\nSeachill is not the only company that's been reviewing its pay arrangements.\nAt Pennine Foods in Sheffield, owned by the huge food group, 2 Sisters, workers have voted for strike action after the company announced it would cut Sunday and bank holiday pay as part of plans to standardise payments to staff.\nElsewhere, staff benefits are also being trimmed. At Caffe Nero, workers are no longer entitled to a free panini whilst staff at Eat will no longer have paid-for breaks.\nIn a recent parliamentary debate on the issue, both companies along with some other household names were in the firing line from MPs; DIY chain B&Q came in for particular criticism.\n\"Companies such as B&Q use the introduction of the national living wage to 'reform their pay and reward structures', as they put it. That is a euphemism for cutting staff pay,\" said Joan Ryan, Labour MP for Enfield North.\n\"I have found disturbing and, quite frankly, shameful the way in which some large employers in the service sector have used the introduction of a living wage as an excuse to cut basic work entitlements,\" added Julie Cooper, Labour MP for Burnley and Padiham.\nMore than 130,000 people signed a petition against B&Q's planned cuts to employee benefits. It announced in February that it would be cutting Sunday pay and reducing bank holiday pay and bonuses for some staff, although it raised its basic pay to \u00a37.66 an hour in April.\nB&Q said many workers would be better off or unaffected by its changes but that it had now extended compensation to staff who would lose out.\nCaffe Nero said its workers would still get a discount for food. Eat said all employees would be compensated through a pay rate above the current national living wage.\nIn the last year, Morrisons, Tesco and Waitrose have also altered payments but they all insisted that it wasn't anything to do with the introduction of the national living wage.\nSome aren't surprised that employers are having to make changes.\n\"Increasing the national living wage was the right thing to do but no-one can doubt that there will have to be adjustments,\" says Simon Walker, the boss of the Institute of Directors.\n\"Companies have to be profitable so they are going to have to make adjustments and cut backs if they have to pay higher wages in order to break even.\n\"They also face a number of other cost increases including the apprenticeship levy and auto enrolment for pensions.\"\nThe chancellor cut corporation tax to help ease the burden on employers. He's called on companies to follow the spirit of the law.\nThe owners of Seachill say it has a very loyal, long serving workforce and ensuring that they were fairly rewarded, whilst continuing to provide a first class service to its customers, is a priority.\nBut for Tom and many of his colleagues, the cuts to overtime are proving hard to swallow.",

The remainder of the province will transition over time.\"\nThe general said that the agreement reflected the \"growing capacity and capability of the Afghan security forces to meet the security needs\" of Afghanistan.\nThe BBC's Quentin Sommerville in Kabul says that the agreement is short on specifics - no timetable has been reached on when the special forces will leave. But it does allow Mr Karzai to save face.\nAfghan defence ministry spokesman Gen Zahir Azimi said that the Afghan army \"will take the lead\" after international special forces withdraw from Nerkh district, \"so this problem will be solved within a few days\".\nHowever our correspondent says that it is far from certain that the already stretched Afghan special forces will be able to establish security in Wardak once Nato has left.\nWardak is a critical province. Located near Kabul, it has been used as staging post for a number of large-scale attacks in the city and has been the recent focus of counter-insurgency operations.\nThe accountability of US forces and local militia working with them has been a growing source of friction in Afghan-US relations.\nWednesday's agreement comes against a backdrop of long-term negotiations over which foreign forces will remain in Afghanistan after Nato's exit in 2014.\nThe bulk of Nato's 100,000 troops are due to leave by the end of that year.",

    "document": "Mr Kasyanov, a former prime minister, is a high-profile critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the opposition RPR-Parnas party.\nRecently Mr Kadyrov called Mr Putin's critics \"enemies\" and \"traitors\".\nRussian opposition politicians have described the posting as a murder threat.\nThe Chechen leader said Mr Kasyanov was seeking cash in Strasbourg for the opposition. \"Whoever doesn't get it will get it!\" he warned.\nLast March Mr Kadyrov spoke out on Instagram about the assassination of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov in Moscow. That message defended one of the Chechens charged over the shooting.\nA day later President Putin gave Mr Kadyrov a top award.\nMr Nemtsov was among several well-known opponents of Mr Putin murdered in the past decade.\nPutin loyalist Kadyrov unleashed on Russian 'traitors'\nRamzan Kadyrov: Putin's key Chechen ally\nMr Kadyrov runs Chechnya with an iron fist - his private militia has been accused of widespread human rights abuses, including torture and assassination.\nHe has close ties to Mr Putin, who encouraged him to stamp out a separatist insurgency in Chechnya. Thousands of civilians died in the North Caucasus republic when Russian troops fought the rebels there in the 1990s.\nThe new video is the latest in a series of threatening messages from Mr Kadyrov against Kremlin critics, whom he accuses of working for the West.\nIt shows Mr Kasyanov talking to Vladimir Kara-Murza, a journalist who runs the pro-democracy opposition movement Open Russia. The movement was launched by exiled oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky.\nThe video was posted late on Sunday and has more than 16,000 \"likes\".\nMr Kasyanov says he sees it as a direct death threat and will demand a criminal investigation.\nIlya Yashin, who co-chairs RPR-Parnas with Mr Kasyanov, called the video \"an open threat to murder Kasyanov\".\nAnother opposition leader, anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny, echoed that view. On Facebook, Mr Navalny said (in Russian) \"there is no longer any doubt that all such statements in recent weeks and specifically this one were approved by Putin and the Kremlin, and quite probably were inspired by them too\".\nThe BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Moscow says they key question now is whether Mr Kadyrov is acting on his own initiative.\nOne theory discussed on Russian social media is that he is being used by the Kremlin to intimidate its critics - particularly as growing economic problems raise the potential for protest.\nOthers suggest that Mr Kadyrov is becoming a dangerous loose cannon - a regional leader who believes he is untouchable, our correspondent reports.\nThe phrase \"Whoever doesn't get it will get it!\" is the title of a thriller that Mr Kadyrov says he has filmed, starring himself as a machine gun-toting all-action hero.\nKadyrov the Instagram fan - by Stephen Ennis, BBC Monitoring:\nRamzan Kadyrov is one of Russia's most popular and controversial Instagram users. Since launching his account in 2013, he has made over 6,000 posts and amassed 1.6m followers.\nHe promotes himself on the site as a devout Muslim and a strong leader. One recent post featured him grappling with a crocodile.\nThis is not the first time he has used Instagram to lash out at the Russian opposition. In May 2015, hours after the premiere of an Open Russia film about him, he posted a clip of himself firing a machine gun, with the slogan \"Whoever doesn't get it will get it soon!\"\nThe following day Open Russia co-ordinator Vladimir Kara-Murza was taken seriously ill with poisoning.\nInstagram has rapidly grown in popularity in Russia in recent years and at the end of 2015 had more than 10m active users.",

She says she has seen the iridescent clouds only once with her own eyes - and she knows precisely when and what to look for.\nSuch phenomena could have taken Munch completely by surprise, she believes.\nThe team first started investigating the possible link between the unusual meteorology and The Scream when consultant Svein Fikke observed a display of the clouds in 2014.\nHe managed to take a series of stunning photos, and then started delving deeper into the story.\nSome very rare cloud types are reported to be increasing in frequency and distribution, perhaps due to climate change.\nAn example would be Noctilucent Clouds. These are the highest clouds on Earth, forming at altitudes of 80km and more. There is evidence to suggest they are becoming more visible at lower latitudes than used to be the case.\nIt is conceivable similar trends might occur with Nacreous Clouds, Dr Muri said, although no statistics can justify such a statement yet.\n\"We know that the troposphere is warming and expanding while the stratosphere above is compressing and cooling. So, the temperature characteristics of minus 80C and below might become commonplace in the future,\" she speculated.",

    "document": "But the Taliban has been regaining ground in Sangin and is now poised to recapture the district from Afghan forces. Why is this part of Helmand so important to both sides?\nRegaining full control of Sangin would increase the Taliban's mobility in the north of the province and cut a key supply line for Afghan forces with Lashkar Gah.\nSangin is also a rich opium production centre - meaning potential tax revenue for the Taliban from the drugs trade.\nThe big question now is whether the Taliban can maintain their recent territorial gains in the district. Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, told the BBC late on Monday that the district administrative office had been abandoned by government forces. But Taliban fighters are cautious about entering it, he said.\nThe Taliban is more likely to keep administrative offices unoccupied, as they have done in the Musa Qala and Nowzad regions of Helmand - where 90% of the districts are said to be under Taliban control but the centres are with the government forces. The Taliban intentionally avoids centres of the districts, where they can easily be targeted.\nKeeping control of the centre of Sangin would not be easy for the militants, but they may have an advantage among the local population. Many locals are resentful of government troops following military operations earlier this year which they say wrought unwarranted destruction to homes, farms, and other property.\nThe Taliban will probably seek to exploit that resentment and foster as much sympathy for their cause as possible, as they did in Kunduz where fighters could be seen posing for photos with civilians.\nIf the government wants to wrest total control of the area from the militants, it should look to win hearts and minds - a strategy once trumpeted by the foreign forces which controlled this part of the country.\nIt should deploy troops who do not bear the grudges of those who fought in the civil war in 90s, soldiers who are not trying to settle old scores. Above all, it should do all it can to avoid perpetuating a cycle of violence in which the biggest victims are the local civilians.",

    "document": "In 2007, the Icelandic economy appeared healthy. Its real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was 35% higher than it was in 2002, unemployment was 2.3% and government debt was a modest 27% of GDP.\nHowever, the assets of its three largest banks had grown to over nine times GDP, a size that made it impossible for the Icelandic central bank to act as an effective lender of last resort.\nThus, regardless of the quality of the banks' assets, the predictable consequence was a bank run and the subsequent collapse of the Icelandic banking system.\nFollowing the demise of its banks, Iceland imposed capital controls to prevent massive outflows and a plunge in the value of its currency.\nRecapitalisation of its banking system and other crisis-related expenses caused government debt to rise to 95% of GDP by 2011.\nHowever, a successful International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme cushioned the impact: real GDP fell by a less-than-expected 6.6% in 2009 and 4.1% in 2010, before returning to growth.\nIcelandic authorities protected the holders of domestic deposits, who enjoyed uninterrupted access to their accounts; the UK and Dutch governments stepped in to protect deposit holders in UK and Dutch branches of Icelandic banks.\nIn 2013, the European Free Trade Association (Efta) court ruled that Iceland did not breach its obligations, either by treating domestic deposits differently or by not accepting legal obligation for foreign branch deposits.\nToday, Iceland faces the difficult challenge of removing its capital controls in an orderly fashion but the IMF expects real GDP growth of 4.1% in 2015.\nIn 2008, the Cypriot economy was more like that of an emerging market nation than a modern European one, but the country was enjoying an economic boom.\nCypriot real GDP had grown by 27% between 2002 and 2008. The growth, however, had been fuelled by inflows of foreign bank deposits and foreign loans to banks.\nAs a result, the assets of commercial banks with Cypriot parents expanded to over five times' Cypriot GDP.\nUnlike the Icelandic banks, the Cypriot banks had a credible lender of last resort: their central bank was a member of the Eurosystem.\nUnfortunately, they were heavily exposed to Greece.\nCypriot banks were hit hard by the restructuring of Greek sovereign debt in 2012.\nIn March 2013, the Cypriot authorities were in a desperate situation. Either they had to make a sizable contribution to a European Stability Mechanism/IMF rescue package or the emergency loans Cypriot banks had been receiving through its central bank would be cut off.\nWithout the rescue package, saving the Cypriot banking system would be likely to require exiting from the euro area, adopting a new currency and recapitalising the banks by printing money.\nThis would cause the value of the new currency to plummet, taking with it the real value of Cypriot pensions, wages and bank accounts.\nTo avoid catastrophe, the Cypriot authorities looked to the one source of readily available funds: Cypriot bank deposits. Initially they planned to impose a levy on all deposits but ultimately insured depositors were spared.\nTo stem a run, capital controls were imposed. Banks were closed for two weeks and when they were reopened there was a limit on daily withdrawals.\nReal GDP fell by 2.4% in 2012, 5.4% in 2013 and 2.3% in 2014. Unemployment rose to 16.2% in 2014 and government debt has climbed to 107% of GDP.\nCurrently, the outlook for Cyprus is guarded.\nThe country finally returned to economic growth this year and the capital controls were removed entirely in April. However, further economic reform is necessary to ensure sustainable growth.\nGreece currently faces a choice similar to the one faced by Cyprus in 2013.\nIts banking system depends for its survival on emergency lending controlled by the ECB.\nBank runs have forced the imposition of capital controls, temporary bank closures and limits on deposit withdrawals.\nThe consequences of leaving the Eurosystem are likely to be as dire for Greece as they would have been for Cyprus. Reaching an accommodation with its creditors is the preferred outcome.\nReal GDP has fallen by almost 30% in Greece since 2007, partly because of severe fiscal austerity.\nUnemployment was 26% in 2014 and there has been an exodus of skilled labour.\nAs with Cyprus, and unlike with Iceland, any lasting recovery will require significant economic and fiscal reform.\nGreece ranks 61st in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index, edging out Russia and Cyprus (at 64) but behind Tunisia; Iceland is 12th.\nGovernment debt was already a massive 113% of annual GDP in 2008 and now stands at 180%.\nCapital controls were necessary in Iceland and Cyprus, and in Greece today, but they come at a cost.\nMany view them as an assault on civil liberties; others see them as a chance to profit.\nEven in Iceland, a remote island nation, evasion and avoidance appear to have been widespread.\nSome say they promote disrespect for the law and the belief that once again the wealthy, sophisticated and corrupt are benefiting at the expense of the rest of society.\nAnne Sibert is a professor of Economics at Birkbeck, University of London, a fellow of the Centre for Economic Policy Research. She is a former member of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of Iceland.",

Not enough putts dropped on the back nine - he gave himself multiple opportunities - and he had to settle for the consolation prize of a slot in The Open.\nRamsay asked about Andy Murray in the aftermath and called the now two-time Wimbledon champion an inspiration. \"Watching Andy play at Wimbledon this week, watching Jamie play, those guys are huge inspirations for Scottish people,\" he said. \"To win Wimbledon is a massive achievement and I think sometimes we take that for granted, we forget how good he is.\n\"It's great watching him, because he's Scottish and because he's got that grit and fire. I love that attitude. For me, every week is about trying to be the best I can be.\n\"When I'm 60, I want to sit in my chair watching the golf and be able to say that I won X number of tour titles and that I couldn't squeeze any more out of the talent I had. Talent is great, but if you don't have that hard work ethic, you're not to get anywhere.\"\nRamsay has won three times on tour, the most recent of them being the Trophee Hassan in March last year. He's played in The Open five times, missing the cut on three occasions. His best finish was 58th at Muirfield in 2013. He was tied for 68th at St Andrews last year.\nHis performance here rather came out of the blue. Ramsay finished sixth in China in May, but his form since then has been poor, his best finish a 43rd. His season had been a grind up until Castle Stuart.\n\"I just loved it out there,\" he said. \"I didn't come out with a tentative attitude, which has sometimes been my fault in the past. I hit some great shots.\n\"I knew, standing on that 10th tee, that I could win the tournament and that's a great feeling. I just have to take that into the next year and see if I can get this title in the bag one of these years.\n\"From a confidence point of view, I will think to myself that I had a chance to win a huge tournament. You're halfway there when you believe you can do it. I know I have a lot more in the tank.\"\nCastle Stuart didn't get the champion it wanted, with due credit to the excellent Noren, but it was a terrific host venue. The troubling aspect - and it's reflective of golf's serious problem - was the size of the crowd on each of the four days.\nThe total attendance for Thursday-Sunday was 41,809. The final round brought the smallest number of fans - 8,733 - of the week.\nThere was a Murray effect there for sure. But it's a much wider issue than that.\nLast year at Gullane, the Scottish brought in a total crowd of 63,000, which was, in turn, less than the 65,833 that attended the year before at Royal Aberdeen.\nThe small numbers this time are partly on account of geography but also to do with golf's diminishing attraction as a spectator sport.\nNone of that bothered Noren, of course. Nor Ramsay. If there was a competition to find the widest smile at Castle Stuart last night, the two of them would have been locked in a dead heat.",

This meant too many pupils had been ill-prepared for secondary schools, Ofsted said.\nIt also said governors lacked expertise to challenge senior leaders on teaching quality.\nBut inspectors added that most of the principals it contacted felt they were well supported by trust officers and that SPTA human resource departments had assisted in managing under-performing staff.\nIn a letter to Sir Paul, Ofsted said: \"In summary, there is some evidence of effective school improvement, particularly in the initial start-up period after conversion to academy status. However, the quality and impact of governance arrangements are variable.\n\"There are further concerns regarding the depth and accuracy of SPTA analysis of data showing pupils' progress and the contribution this makes to rapid school improvement.\n\"Above all, there are too many underperforming academies which have remained in this position for too long.\"\nAn SPTA spokesman said the trust recognised the important role Ofsted had played in monitoring standards in the school system.\n\"The trust also recognises that Ofsted comments around areas for improvement are suggested on the basis of constructive dialogue to ensure all children receive a first class education, regardless of the school setting,\" he said.\n\"Equally however, the trust also recognises that the evidence to support these comments was largely drawn from a small sample of six schools, in a multi-academy trust that supports in excess of 42 schools and which contains two Teaching Schools, accredited through the National College of School Leadership.\n\"Whilst the trust looks forward to discussions with Ofsted about how to improve our performance, it is important to consider the facts in relation to the whole group, not just the six schools that were inspected.\"\nSPTA is the third chain to be criticised by Ofsted, with critical letters recently sent to both the Kemnal Academies Trust (TKAT) and the E-ACT Trust - one of England's biggest academy organisations.",

But there have been some questionable calls made.\n\"It would be shocking to lose Silverstone from the calendar and even more shocking to lose a British Grand Prix when you consider 80% of the teams are based within the UK and how much the UK contributes to F1 from a historical point of view.\"",

Can we do better in our marketing and promotion, and use social media and digital better?\n\"We will look at how we connect with our audiences, at our TV coverage, our structure of tournaments. Also how many should be in the calendar, and where they should be based? It will be a major work.\"\nHe says there are \"five tennis stakeholders\" to consider - players, tournaments, fans, sponsors and the media.\nThe ATP's review comes after another successful sell-out World Tour Finals at London's O2 Arena, where close to 263,000 fans watched the top eight players compete.  It brought the overall attendance on the 2015 ATP World Tour season to an all-time record of 4.5 million fans (excluding Grand Slams).\nMr Kermode says some 15% to 20% of the ATP's annual revenue's annual revenues come from the end of year finals, so as an event it is \"financially very important\".\nNow, the finals will stay in London until 2018, beyond the original 2016 deadline.\nAnd Mr Kermode says that while other cities offered more money, they did not provide the profile - or \"statement for tennis\" - he says they currently enjoy at the O2.\nThe 50-year-old also says he has made a conscious effort to present the ATP finals in a different way to other London tournaments, Wimbledon and the Aegon at Queen's (where he used to be tournament director).\n\"We have made it an entertainment event as much as a sports event,\" says Mr Kermode.\nWorld Tour Finals sponsor Barclays will pull out after the end of 2016, as it cuts back its sport sponsorship, but Mr Kermode says the ATP is confident of finding another big backer.\n\"The issue for us at present is whether we go for a two year sponsor deal around London, or a longer deal that is linked to London and another venue somewhere else,\" says the keen Neil Young music fan.\n\"We are talking to five companies as potential sponsors, and want to be quick in securing a deal.\"\nThe ATP has been boosted by the fact that in the past six months it has secured deals worth $160m (\u00c2\u00a3106m) over the next five years.\nThese include a deal with Emirates, reportedly worth $50m, to replace beer brand Corona as an ATP World Tour sponsor.  The airline's logo will replace those of the Mexican beverage on nets at events.\nNew deals have also been signed with Peugeot, Maui Jim Sunglasses, Indian IT services group Infosys, and Chinese online video business Letv.\nInfosys has been given the task of crunching numbers and stats for tennis fans, and sports media, in the same way that IBM does at Wimbledon and SAP does for the WTA women's tour.\n\"In the US sports stats are of huge interest, historically less so in Europe,\" says Mr Kermode. \"But many new-generation fans are interested in player statistics, and it is an area we want to focus on.\n\"The more knowledge we acquire about our sport, the more fans want it.\"\nWith the sponsorship tank nearly full, he says that there is still room to sign other player-focussed deals with firms providing things like medical services and applications, and fitness products.\nMr Kermode, who is approaching the last 12 months of his current three year term, says he is keen to stay on for another period in office, but that the final decision lies with the ATP board, not him.\nOne projected development he still wants to get off the ground is an end-of-year finals event for the top eight under-21 players in the world.  Originally envisaged for the 2016 calendar, he now says that deadline may be looking tight.\n\"A final decision has still to be made,\" he says, but - whenever launched - it is envisaged the event will slot in between the Paris Masters in late October and ATP finals in London in mid-November.\nAs well as giving young players experience of high-level, pressurised, competition in the global spotlight, and thus increasing their ability to compete at the top ends of ATP events and Grand Slams, he also plans to use the event to innovate.\nOne of these proposed changes might be to the player warm-up, he says.\n\"We currently bring the players dramatically on court at the O2, as though they are coming out for a boxing match, which everyone finds very exciting, \" he says.\n\"But then you get the player warm up, and things cool off for about 10 minutes. It does not matter if you are in the stadium, there is still that buzz, but it can be bit of a dampener for TV viewers.\"\nMeanwhile, he remains sanguine about the day when the \"Big Four\" male players start retiring.\n\"Genuinely, I am not worried about it all,\" says Mr Kermode.\n\"It is like when you had the Borg and McEnroe era, then they retired and you had players like Becker, Agassi, and Edberg, coming through.\"\nHe points to players such as Nishikori (\"huge in Asia\") , Roanic (\"that North American presence\"),  and Dimitrov (\"still to fulfil his potential\"),  as well as youngsters such as Kyrgios and Coric.\n\"There is a great contrast in styles, and good geographical spread,\" he says.  \"Sport is a very simple business model, basically it is about caring about someone winning against someone else, and that will continue.\"",

In Italy the restriction lasts for four months following the change of partner.\nBy contrast, in the US, Canada, France and many other countries there is a complete ban on donations from men who have ever had sex with men.\nWhilst welcoming the lifting of the ban in the UK, some still regard the one year deferral as too long.\nStonewall Chief Executive Ben Summerskill. \"To retain a blanket ban on any man who has had sex with another man in the last year, even if he has only had oral sex, remains disproportionate on the basis of available evidence.\"\nBut Sir Nick Partridge, Chief Executive of Terrence Higgins Trust said: \"The remaining deferral regulation for sexually active gay men is based on their heightened risk, as a group, of sexually acquired blood-borne viruses.\"\nA one year deferral period for donation applies to other groups as well: for example anyone who has been sexually active in countries where HIV/Aids is very common, and anyone who has had sex with a prostitute.\nNHS Blood and Transplant has a complete list of who can and cannot donate.\nThe hope will be that the shift in policy will lead to an increase in the number of donors.\nIf you want more detail about the reasoning behind the decision to lift the ban, then the full report from the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) can be read here.",

Businesses had called for clarity since the UK announced it was leaving the EU's tariff-free trading area.\nMinisters said the plans would mean the \"freest and most frictionless possible trade\" with the rest of Europe.\nThe newly-published paper says the UK could ask Brussels to establish a \"temporary customs union\" after it leaves the EU in March 2019. During this period it would also expect to be able to negotiate its own international trade deals, which it cannot currently do as a customs union member.\nOnce any temporary arrangement expired, the paper says the UK would look to agree either a \"highly streamlined\" border with the EU or a new \"partnership\" with no customs border at all.\nThe plan has drawn a mixed response, with Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer calling it \"incoherent and inadequate\" and \"fantastical and contradictory\". However, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said it was \"encouraging\", and the Institute of Directors said it was \"hugely positive step\".\nGuy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit negotiator, tweeted that the idea of \"invisible borders\" was \"a fantasy\".\nMs Sturgeon posted an initial reaction to the customs union plan on Twitter, saying: \"Seems UK gov is back to its daft 'have cake and eat it' approach to Brexit.

It's nonsensical and ridiculous.\n\"I think it increasingly makes the UK government look like a bit of a laughing stock.\n\"I wish we weren't leaving the EU, but if the UK is leaving the EU then the common sense thing to do is to stay in the single market and to stay in the customs union.

If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it's a duck.\n\"They seem to be going to great lengths to differentiate something that is pretty much identical to the customs union from the customs union. That's what makes, I think, the UK government increasingly look a bit ridiculous.\"\nWhile customs is a reserved matter, the paper says the UK government is \"committed\" to working with devolved administrations \"to understand the practical impact of new arrangements. It notes \"specific issues\" such as the Irish border and \"implications\" for ports in Scotland and Wales.\nMr Davis said: \"We will take on board their concerns but our primary aim is to look after the people of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

In Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, says Mr Moran, \"you still have wide open areas of wilderness and desert where people are able to get across\".\nThat is if they don't die trying.\nDonald Trump reckons he has the answer - a \"beautiful\" wall spanning all four states which abut Mexico. It is a plan which goes down well with the men and women on the front line.\nAs vice president of the National Border Patrol Council, Mr Moran is union spokesman for 17,000 border agents who are, collectively, supporting the presumptive Republican nominee for president of the United States.\n\"Mr Trump seems to be the only candidate that's actually talking about border enforcement and fixing the immigration laws of the United States,\" says Mr Moran.\n\"This is a country built on the rule of law and over the past few decades we have carved out entire sections of our immigration laws and just ignored them. President Obama has just thrown out enforcement.\"\nIt is certainly true that the United States has looked the other way for many years as millions of illegal migrants set up home, although the question of enforcement is complex.\nAny Mexican you ask in California will tell you they are there to work - often as builders, nannies, farmhands and cleaners, propping up the American economy, they say.\nMr Trump, in contrast, accuses immigrants of costing the US billions of dollars in education, healthcare, housing and welfare as well as of committing crimes and putting Americans out of work.\nTrump wants to deport every illegal immigrant - could he?\nWhy Mexicans are troubled by Trump\nNaming the people who die in the desert\nShopping for a perilous journey\nIt is this potent mix of nationalism and protectionism which is animating his supporters in this angriest of elections.\nAnd so Mr Trump wants to throw out every single undocumented immigrant. They would later be allowed to reapply for legal entry, he says, as long as they paid a hefty fee.\nIt is, by definition, difficult to count people living in the shadows and the numbers are therefore contested, but research estimated the number of unauthorised immigrants inside the United States in 2014, from all countries, at 11.3 million.\nExactly how they would be expelled and how much it would cost is, as with so much of Mr Trump's policy platform, not at all clear.\nThe tycoon-turned-politician has though given a sliver of detail about the \"beautiful\" wall he says he would build along the 1,989 mile border.\nMexico, he says, would pay for its construction or else Mexicans in the US would be prevented from sending money back to their families.\nA Trump White House would \"impound all remittance payments derived from illegal wages,\" according to the presidential contender's website.\nThat is no small threat - remittances from all Mexicans abroad were worth $24.8bn in 2015 according to the Bank of Mexico, more than the country's oil revenues - but could it be done?\n\"Is Trump going to steal the money,\" asks the former president of Mexico, Vicente Fox Quesada, incredulously. \"How can any human being think like that? It's incredible!\n\"It's not going to happen,\" he tells the BBC. \"Forget it. We're not going to pay for that [expletive] wall!\"\nThis sentiment is echoed in Tijuana itself, often in similarly robust language.\nMr Trump's description of Mexican immigrants as killers and rapists hasn't done much for his popularity here - an ugly mural with the caption \"Rape Trump\" adorns the border wall on the southern side - and in the colourful markets where Trump pi\u00c3\u00b1atas (papier mache effigies filled with sweets which children whack open at birthday parties) are selling like hot tacos, they have a wary eye on the superpower nextdoor.\nBeating the American businessman with a stick is popular, it seems.\n\"People are worried by everything he's saying about Mexico and Mexicans,\" says Carmen Espinoza, in Spanish, behind the counter of her shop which has just one Trump pi\u00c3\u00b1ata left.\n\"We're not criminals, we're nothing like that. We are hardworking people who simply want to find work. Don't vote for him!\"\nOf course some Mexican immigrants are criminals and in the past few years many have faced deportation from the US.\nIn fact, President Barack Obama has reportedly deported more illegal immigrants than any president before him, although critics say that number has fallen sharply during his second term.\nAs a result, across Tijuana we find what could be the scene from another Donald Trump dream - a room full of freshly deported \"illegals\".\nIn this half-way house for new arrivals - the Casa del Migrante, a Christian mission which offers shelter, legal advice and psychological support - they're serving dinner.\nFor some of the men and women here this is the first real taste of Mexico since they were children.\n11.3 million\nEstimated unauthorised immigrants in the US\n235,413 Number of people US Immigration and Customs Enforcement \"removed or returned\" in 2015\nVictor Manuel Perez Monroi, who lived in Spokane, Washington, from the ages of six to 61, is typical.

They would go bankrupt.\"\nMr Perez is not the only one here struggling with his new life. Other migrants tell similar stories of infractions, minor and major, which resulted in their deportation and, often, in the potential of permanent separation from their families.\nLooking across at Tijuana from the US side, is the border patrol agent Shawn Moran sympathetic?\n\"Oh, yes,\" he insists. \"If I was in the same situation, I would try to get my family out of there and go somewhere where I could make some money and give them a better way to live.\n\"But we have a system in place for that. I am not against immigration at all. I'm for legal immigration. I'm against illegal immigration.\"\nIt is this simple defence of the laws of the United States which encapsulates why many Americans have turned to Trump - but it also explains why, for many Mexicans, the prospect of his winning the White House would be their worst nightmare.",

Critics say that could mean a firecracker or a simple slingshot.\nDemonstrators who are masked, for example with a scarf, could face up to five years in prison. Governors - who are appointed by the government - would be given the right to order police investigations.\nThe government argues the measures are needed for security and protection from violent protests and are in line with European standards. The opposition says the bill, if approved, is bound to turn Turkey into a police state.\nIt comes at a sensitive time for Turkish domestic politics. A general election will be held on 7 June and peace talks to end three decades of Kurdish insurgency have faltered recently, as splits emerged between the governing AK Party and Mr Erdogan over how to proceed.\nThe Kurds are particularly wary of the new bill, saying it could be used specifically to target them. It was introduced after pro-Kurdish protests in October, in which almost 50 people died.\nMehmet Ersoy, an MP in the ruling, Islamist-rooted AKP, says those protests convinced the government to adopt extra police measures in order to \"stop provocations\".\nThe bill would have a positive impact on the peace process, he told the BBC.\n\"Let's see who really wants peace. Let's take the masked vandals with Molotov cocktails off the scene,\" he said. \"We just want to stop the violence.\"\nHowever, Ertugrul Kurkcu, an MP from the pro-Kurdish party HDP, does not share that optimism.\n\"If the gendarmerie, who will now be under the interior ministry, or the police rely on the powers granted to them and try to intimidate, pressurise or use violence against people, that will damage the peace atmosphere. There will no longer be a suitable climate for peace talks - neither politically, nor psychologically,\" he said.\nThe main opposition CHP party plans to launch a constitutional court challenge to the bill soon.\nAkif Hamzacebi, a CHP member of parliament, argues that the bill's main aim is to crush public dissent and prevent a \"second wave of unrest similar to the Gezi events\" - the anti-government protests that took place in June 2013.\n\"The government is extending police powers in order to control dissent. However, such bills fuel more dissent,\" he said.\nAmnesty International has condemned the bill, and the US State Department has expressed concern.\nState department spokesman Jeff Rathke said: \"We believe curbs on freedom of assembly weaken rather than strengthen democratic societies.\"\nLast week the Turkish parliament also passed a bill that would allow the government to ban access to websites \"threatening lives, public order or people's freedom\" even before seeking a court order.\nMr Erdogan tolerates little dissent and more than 70 people have faced legal action for insulting him since he became the country's president last August.\nThose who have been prosecuted include a 13-year-old for a Facebook post, several students, satirical cartoonists, a Miss Turkey beauty queen and an actress.",

Many clubs in England have taken it on board - getting kids in during the day, giving them more opportunities to practise the disciplines involved in football.\n\"The evidence is all there that they're improving quicker than they were previously under a hybrid programme where all the coaching was taking place in the evening or at weekends.\"\nThe other important gauge of success is academic achievement.\nExam results will not be available from the SFA project until this summer, but Graeme High School in Falkirk ran a pilot scheme - of which Craig Sibbald and Celtic youngster Paul McMullan are graduates - that allows for some analysis.\n\"Last year we had a group of 14 or 15 and the vast majority were highly successful, able pupils, one with five Highers, two with four Highers, three with three Highers and a suite of other academic achievements,\" headteacher Lesley Carroll told BBC Scotland.\n\"Most of them have gone on to professional clubs but they have got a fallback position. They have been some of our top-performing academic pupils too because not only do they have to be elite athlete footballers, they have to have what the SFA would call a growth mindset.\n\"They're not afraid of targets, hard work, commitment, drive and confidence.\"\nIndeed, Carroll believes there is an argument the programme helps the performance school students achieve better results in their other subjects, though she admits no \"real forensic research has been done into that\".\nBut it will be the level of footballing development that determines exactly how McClair and the SFA proceed in terms of their future performance strategy.",

    "document": "In a series of tweets on Tuesday morning the president framed any disclosure of intelligence information as a calculated move to advance US national security priorities.\nIn a press conference hours later, National Security Adviser HR McMaster said Mr Trump's revelations where \"wholly appropriate\".\nThis was always going to be the most effective response, as the president has broad powers to declassify whatever he deems necessary. As the old Richard Nixon line goes: \"When the president does it, that means it is not illegal\".\nThe president's explanation is not absolution, however. A wave of the hand on Twitter isn't going to make this story go away any time soon. Here are five reasons why.\nLet's get the impeachment question out of the way first. Shortly after the Washington Post story detailing the allegations broke, there were cries of \"treason\" from Mr Trump's more vociferous critics and calls for immediate removal from office.\nThe charge that Mr Trump, through ignorance or boastfulness, casually disclosed highly classified intelligence for no reason may not be a criminal offence, but that doesn't mean it wouldn't create a political controversy that could, in a worst-case scenario for the president, end in his impeachment.\nThe process for impeachment for \"high crimes and misdemeanours\" as outlined in the US constitution is a political act. A simple majority of the House of Representatives can impeach, initiating a trial in the Senate and a two-thirds vote necessarily for removal.\nAs the writers of Lawfare Blog point out, Mr Trump's opponents could accuse him of violations of his oath of office to \"preserve, protect, and defend\" the US Constitution - a catch-all category cited in the three previous times a president has been seriously threatened with impeachment.\nJust because it's possible, however, doesn't mean it's likely. And again, it has nothing to do with the law and everything to do with politics - and how the story plays out from here.\nLike Indiana Jones looking at a chamber full of snakes, many in the Trump White House must be muttering to themselves: \"Russians. Why did it have to be the Russians?\"\nAllegations of cosier-than-desired relations with the US geopolitical adversary have bedevilled Mr Trump since the early days of his presidential campaign.\nHe's been questioned about the praise he's lavished on President Vladimir Putin, some of his aides are caught up in the ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the US 2016 election, his attorney general was forced to recuse himself because of an undisclosed meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and his first national security adviser was fired for obfuscating about his Russia ties (and is one of the people under FBI investigation to boot).\nAll of this was hanging in the air as Mr Trump met with Mr Kislyak and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov last week, just hours after he fired James Comey, the FBI director in overseeing the Russia investigation. US press was barred from attending, and the only photos that were released came from the Russian state-run news service.\nIt was never going to be a good look. Now, in light of the Washington Post's revelations, it's a terrible one.\nMr Trump's tweets explained that he was \"sharing\" information with the Russian officials in order to foster co-operation on important global issues like the fight against the so-called Islamic State. As Mr Trump points out, he has the \"absolute right\" to do so.\nThe fact that it's the Russians involved, however, means the story will pack that much more powerful a punch.\nBack in February the Wall Street Journal reported that US intelligence officials were withholding sensitive intelligence information from Mr Trump out of concern that the material could be \"leaked or compromised\".\nDuring the presidential campaign, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton regularly said Mr Trump could not be trusted to competently manage the intricacies of US foreign policy.\nNow, according to the Washington Post report, Mr Trump may have disclosed information provided to the US by a key ally that has \"access to the inner workings of the Islamic State\".\nThe Post said that its sources \"declined to identify the ally but said it has previously voiced frustration with Washington's inability to safeguard sensitive information related to Iraq and Syria\". One US official said it was potentially a \"blow\" to the US relationship with that ally.\nIf key US allies become reluctant to share intelligence data with the US, that would be a significant blow to the nation's national security - even if the details of this particular story are never fully established.\nThrow in last week's Trump tweet implying that he - or someone - may have \"tapes\" of conversations made in the White House, and the result may be a chilling effect on US foreign relations across the board.\nThis latest controversy should also be viewed in the context of what has become a simmering feud between the president and members of the intelligence community.\nShortly after he tweeted out that two-part explanation of his White House meeting with the Russians, Mr Trump sent another message on a familiar theme - leaks.\n\"I have been asking Director Comey and others, from the beginning of my administration, to find the LEAKERS in the intelligence community...\"\nBack in January then-President-elect Trump sent a tweet comparing leaky intelligence agencies to Nazi Germany.\nThe president is clearly angered by what he views as a litany of embarrassing disclosures -about phone calls with leaders of Australia and Mexico, conversations his national security adviser had with the Russian ambassador and salacious details from a Trump-Russia dossier circulated among intelligence officials.\nThe president has threatened massive re-organisation of the US intelligence bureaucracy and an aggressive investigation into the source of the leaks - and it appears members of that community are striking back.\nMonday evening, upon hearing of details about the Washington Post story, Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine echoed a familiar lament.\n\"Can we have a crisis-free day?\" she said. \"That's all I'm asking.\"\nOn Tuesday morning Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell offered a similar take.\n\"We could do with a little less drama from the White House on a lot of things,\" he told Bloomberg Television, \"so we can focus on our agenda, which is deregulation, tax reform and repealing and replacing Obamacare.\"\nA few of the Republican usual suspects who have been more outspoken in their criticism are continuing on that tack.\nCongressman Justin Amash of Michigan tweeted that the White House should share \"details of the president's meeting\" with Congress.\nOnce again Senator John McCain of Arizona found something the president did \"deeply disturbing\".\nBarring further revelations, however, the president has constructed a defence around which Republicans can rally. While members of Mr Trump's party may grouse about the ongoing administration fiascos, previous complaints have been followed by inaction. Until there is evidence to the contrary, this time looks to be no different.\nLast week reporters raged over the fact that White House officials, from Vice-President Mike Pence on down, put forward an explanation regarding why the president had fired FBI Director James Comey that was completely undercut within moments of Mr Trump opening his mouth in a sit-down interview on Thursday with NBC News.\nThe president would later tweet that because he is a \"very active president\" his press team can't be relied upon to convey his positions with \"prefect accuracy\".\n\"Why were so many people giving answers that just weren't correct?\" Jonathan Karl asked Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. \"Were you guys in the dark?\"\nNeedless to say reporters this week took the early White House spin that Mr Trump only discussed \"common threats\" with the Russians, per Deputy National Security Advisor Dina Powell, with more than a grain of salt. It appears their scepticism was at least partially validated when, on Tuesday morning, Mr Trump said he had shared \"facts pertaining to terrorism\" with Russia.\nPresidents and the media typically have an adversarial relationship, but this White House is rapidly burning through any residual goodwill it may have had.\nGiven that Mr Trump and his team often refer to the press as the \"opposition party\", however, the may not lose much sleep over this development.\nTwitter: @awzurcher",

    "document": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nFifteen of those won gold. How many of them will be back to defend their titles in 2016 at the Rio Olympic Games, and who else might come through the ranks to join them?\nA week is a long time in sport, never mind four years. But here, BBC Sport takes an early look at some names in the frame for future Olympic fame.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSix of the 12 British Olympians who won more than one medal at London 2012 were younger than 26.\nLaura Trott, 20, and boyfriend Jason Kenny, 24, were both double Olympic champions in the velodrome, Andy Murray, 25,took tennis gold and silver, gymnasts Louis Smith, 23,and Max Whitlock, 19,both picked up two medals, and Rebecca Adlington, 23,won double bronze in freestyle swimming.\nIt would be risky to bet against any of them returning for Rio. Trott, in particular, has the chance to establish a legacy to match Sir Chris Hoy's record medal haul over the next decade, having dominated her team pursuit and omnium events in recent years.\nAdlington has some thinking to do after losing both of her Olympic titles, particularly following the stunning performance of American 15-year-old Katie Ledecky over her favoured 800m distance. Smith has suggested younger gymnasts may prove better all-rounders and push him out of the 2016 gymnastics team.\nBut you can expect Whitlock to be a bedrock of that squad if he maintains his progress, while Trott and Kenny should have at least two more Olympic outings left in them, if not more. Murray will certainly hope to defend his singles title in Rio.\nOf course, 25 is something of an arbitrary barrier. In many sports, you can just as easily win a medal in your 40s or 50s as your teens. Many of GB's gold medallists can be expected to fight for their place, if not retain their title, in four years' time - think of the likes of Jess Ennis, 26,and Mo Farah, 29, plus many of the GB rowing team.\nTo take an example from the opposite end of the spectrum: Nick Skelton is 54, has come back from a broken neck and a hip replacement, and now needs work on his back - but the team showjumping champion plans to return.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nPlenty of likely candidates for Rio 2016 have already broken into the team at London 2012, even if they didn't grab the headlines.\nThe most obvious of these is Adam Gemili, the world junior champion over 100m, whose time of 10.06 seconds in the Olympic semi-finals saw him narrowly miss out on a place in the final alongside the likes of Jamaican winner Usain Bolt and his team-mate Yohan Blake.\nGemili, still only 18, has already been hailed by US rival Tyson Gay as a man with the potential to become one of the greatest in history. By Rio, we will know a lot more about what the former footballer can achieve on the track.\nNineteen-year-old Katarina Johnson-Thompson (heptathlon or long jump) and 20-year-old hurdler Andrew Pozzi are others whose names were lower down the 2012 card but could top the billing in Rio.\nAndrew Osagie, the 800m runner, finished last in his final as David Rudisha stormed home in a new world record, but the Briton ran a personal best that would have won gold at any of the three previous Olympics. He will be 28 in 2016.\nIn contrast Olympic triathlon champion Alistair Brownlee occupied every headline going with his stunning win but will face renewed pressure from younger brother Jonny in Rio.\nThe two look set to dominate their sport for years to come, but 22-year-old Jonny may yet have it in him to surpass his 24-year-old sibling in time for Rio, having taken bronze behind Alistair in Hyde Park.\nIn gymnastics, Rebecca Tunney made her Olympic debut as the youngest member of Team GB at the age of 15, looking assured and unfazed in the women's all-around final. She will spend the next four years increasing the difficulty of her routines although, in a sport with a phenomenally high turnover rate as new gymnasts come on the scene, she already faces a battle to keep her place in the British team.\nFencer James Davis impressed as Britain valiantly scrapped to a narrow defeat by world number ones Italy in the men's team foil event, and he could be joined by world junior epee champion Philip Marsh in Rio.\nTeenager Harry Martin somehow managed to have a decent game for the GB men's hockey team as they were drubbed 9-2 by the Netherlands in their semi-final and is one to watch, while rowing trio Constantine Louloudis, George Nash and Will Satch all picked up bronze at Eton Dorney and will look to upgrade that in Brazil.\nSwimming was a disappointment for Britain at their home Games, and now the search is on for future stars. Siobhan-Marie O'Connor, the 16-year-old breaststroke swimmer from Bath, may be one of them if she can improve her race strategy. Diver Jack Laugher struggled in his 3m competition and finished 27th but he will only be 21 by the time of Rio; Tom Daley, of course, will be just 22 himself.\nSome of the GB stars at Rio 2016 could be in sports entirely new to the Games.\nBritish teams will fancy their chances at medals in rugby sevens, introduced to the Olympic programme for the first time, with Michaela Staniford a name to remember as the 25-year-old captain of the current England women's team.\nKiteboarding replaces windsurfing for Rio and Steph Bridge, a four-time world champion in the sport for Britain, has already seen her profile rise as a result. If windsurfing wins its appeal against losing its place, Izzy Hamilton could benefit. The pro windsurfer is also taking up kiteboarding with a view to reaching Rio, no matter which of the two is included.\nElsewhere in sailing, 22-year-old Katrina Hughes - who lost her battle for a place in the women's 470 boat to Hannah Mills and Saskia Clark, this time - will be back and raring to go alongside partner Penny Clark for 2016.\nA crop of gymnasts are preparing to emerge from the increasingly successful British junior production line. European junior champions Frank Baines and Nile Wilson are two leading lights on the men's side while Youth Olympic trampolinist Nathan Bailey is hoping to star at 2016. Ellie Downie, younger sister of 2008 Olympic gymnast Becky, is just 12 years old now but will be 16 and could have reached her peak by the time of the next Games.\nCycling has a seemingly endless conveyor belt of talent to raid for 2016. Names like Lucy Garner and Simon Yates, both already junior world champions in their short careers, could be firmly established in senior circles well before then.\nOther names waiting in the wings for Rio include boxer Chantelle Cameron, eventer Laura Collett and modern pentathletes Freyja Prentice and Jamie Cooke, the latter tipped by his coaches as a future world champion.\nRowers Pat Lapage and Mike Evans, and Michael Eilberg with Woodlander Farouche in dressage, will also hope to be in Rio.",

The body, shrouded in a white sheet and placed in a weighted bag, was then positioned on a flat board, tipped up, and eased into the Arabian Sea.\nThis occurred at 0600GMT, approximately 12 hours after the firefight during which Osama Bin Laden was shot in the head.\nAfter this first shot, reports ABC News' The Blotter, he was shot again, to make sure that he was dead.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00acThe body was then flown to Afghanistan and Bin Laden's identity was confirmed.

Some sources say facial recognition technology was also used.\nFrom Afghanistan, the body was, it appears, flown to the USS Carl Vinson.\n\"A military officer read prepared religious remarks, which were translated into Arabic by a native speaker,\" a US defence official said.\nAccording to UK-based Imam Dr Abduljalil Sajid, Chairman of the Muslim Council for Religious & Racial Harmony, four key steps need to be followed:\nThere is no necessity for an imam to be present, he says, but the procedures should be carried out by Muslims at least one of whom \"knows the minimum basic Muslim law of burial\".\nWhether any such person was present is impossible to know, he says, based on the limited information provided. But he also questions whether sea burial was appropriate in this case.\nIt is correct to carry out a burial at sea when someone dies on a sea journey, he says, but in this case there was no sound reason for it.\nThe US authorities could surely have found someone - a member of the extensive Bin Laden family, or even one of the many supporters of his \"evil\" ideology - who would have been prepared to give the body a proper burial, he argues.\nHis words were echoed by Mohammed Qudah, a professor of Islamic law at the University of Jordan, who told the Associated Press news agency that burying Bin Laden at sea was not forbidden if there was nobody to receive the body and provide a Muslim burial.\nBut he went on: \"It's neither true nor correct to claim that there was nobody in the Muslim world ready to receive Bin Laden's body.\"\nThe agency also quoted Dubai's grand mufti Mohammed al-Qubaisi, saying that sea burials were permissible only in extraordinary circumstances, adding: \"This is not one of them.\"\n\"If the family does not want him, it's really simple in Islam: You dig up a grave anywhere, even on a remote island, you say the prayers and that's it,\" he said.\nUS officials have given two reasons why a sea burial was chosen. First, that they did not want his grave to become a shrine. Second, that there was no time to negotiate with other countries to arrange a possible burial on land.\nAccording to CBS News, Saudi Arabia refused to take the body. If correct, this suggests that an offer was made - and that had Saudi Arabia accepted the body, there would have been a grave, which could in theory have become a shrine.\nHowever, ABC's Jonathan Karl, writing before the burial was confirmed, painted a different picture:\n\"US officials tell me the last thing they want is for his burial place to become a terrorist shrine.\n\"To avoid that, an informed source tells me, the intention is to bury his body at sea - leaving no definitive location for the final resting place of his body.\"",

There's an argument that YouTube should be doing more to push its subscription model, but they are still rolling it out.\n\"It's still more than artists get on Facebook.

    "document": "The team is processing satellite images to show how rocks in a belt that stretches from Europe's Alps to China are slowly accumulating strain.\nMovements on the scale of just millimetres per year are being sought.\nThe new maps are being made available to help researchers produce more robust assessments of seismic hazard.\nThe kind of change they are trying to chart is not noticeable in the everyday human sense, but over time will put faults under such pressure that they eventually rupture - often with catastrophic consequences.\n\"We may well discover regions that have very small strain rates that we have not been able to detect before,\" said Dr Richard Walters.\n\"And that may well tell us that earthquakes are more likely in some areas that traditionally have been thought of as being completely stable and not at risk of having earthquakes at all.\"\nDr Walters is affiliated to the UK Centre for Observation and Modelling of Earthquakes, Volcanoes and Tectonics (COMET).\nHe announced the start of the new service here in San Francisco, at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union.\nKey to the UK scientists' work is the high performance of the EU's new Sentinel-1 radar satellites.\nThis pair of spacecraft repeatedly and rapidly image the surface of the globe, throwing their data to the ground using a high-speed laser link. And by comparing whole stacks of their pictures in a technique known as interferometry, the COMET group can begin to see the very slow bending and buckling that occurs in the crust as a result of shifting tectonic plates.\nTo initiate the service, the researchers are concentrating on the Alpine-Himalayan seismic belt.\nThis is the sector where most of the deaths arising from big earthquakes occur.\nIn time, however, the mapping exercise will be extended to cover all major seismic hazard zones, including the rim of the Pacific basin - the so-called \"ring of fire\", where large tremors are also a regular occurrence.\nTo be really effective, the team's maps need to be sensitive to movements of about 1mm per year over 100km.\nThe system is not quite there yet, but as the Sentinels gather more and more images, the desired standard should be realised.\nAs a proof of principle - and to give an example of what the new system can do - the COMET group showed off its maps of Turkey at AGU.\nThese capture the 20-25mm/year westwards march of the Anatolian plateau relative to Eurasia.\nThe focus of interest is how tectonic strain is building up along the North and East Anatolian Faults - the trigger points for so many damaging quakes in the past.\nProf Tim Wright, the director of COMET, said one of the breakthroughs that had made the new service possible was simply the prodigious volumes of data the Sentinel satellite system could now feed to the ground.\n\"To give you an example, in just one year of Sentinel operation there are 156 terabytes of data; whereas the entire 10-year archive of Envisat (a previous European radar satellite) has just 24TB.\n\"And we now process the data from the Sentinels automatically within a few hours of getting it.\"\nDr Walters added: \"This is a big data project. We've had funding from the UK's Natural Environment Research Council to build a big data-processing facility, to take these data from the European Space Agency, which they provide for free, and make useful geophysical measurements.\n\"We then serve that to the community. We put the data out there not just for us to analyse and think about seismic hazards, but for scientists all over the world to use.\"\nThe \"Looking inside the Continents from Space\" project has just sent live a website where all the processed maps can be accessed.\nCOMET is also working on a very similar system that would allow scientists to track the behaviour of volcanoes. The Sentinels will also see their slow developing bulges of magma that may precede eruptions.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",

Apart from the proceeds of business rates, it gets all of its money from the UK government.\nSome small taxes - stamp duty and landfill tax - will be devolved by 2018, so this is the last budget where they will not be factored in.\nAt the assembly election Labour - which came out as the largest party and leads the government which includes one Liberal Democrat minister - made a list of pledges which it will need to fund if it is going to keep them.\nThe fact that the Welsh Government is operating a \"one-in, one-out\" approach to spending means every new thing being funded needs something else scrapped to pay for it.\nA few weeks ago First Minister Carwyn Jones said Labour would keep those promises - but warned there were going to be cuts.\nThe government's five-year programme includes:\nMinisters always face pressure to boost funding for the NHS - and there could well be a boost for health in the budget.\nLast week experts warned that NHS Wales faces a \u00a3700m black hole in its finances in just three years time.\nWales cut NHS funding in 2010 and for three years after that - leading to a torrent of criticism - but in recent years budgets have been rising.\nCurrently health and social care account for 48% of the overall Welsh Government budget.\nCould this be the year that the budget for health services reaches 50% - or more?\nMeanwhile local government is lobbying for no further cuts to councils.\nLast year the Welsh Government cut the overall council budget by 2%, although it had felt it was quite generous compared to what happened in England.\nGiven the possibility of difficult battles for Labour around the corner in next May's council elections, ministers might want to give county halls some respite this time.\nWe know that Communities First is set for the axe - worth \u00a330m a year.\nThe scheme has been the Welsh Government's flagship anti-poverty project for 15 years but Communities Secretary Carl Sargeant said he was not convinced it was effective.\nThere are plenty of departments that could see their budgets trimmed - further education and economic development, maybe natural resources.\nEducation Secretary Kirsty Williams has also expressed scepticism about the effectiveness of Schools Challenge Cymru - a fund aimed at underperforming schools. Could the \u00a320m scheme be coming to an end?\nLabour did not win a majority at the last assembly election and must govern by doing deals with others.\nLib Dem Kirsty Williams is already on board with a cabinet post and Labour has an arrangement with Plaid Cymru where the two parties talk about policies in joint committees - a forum where the budget will have been discussed.\nPlaid leader Leanne Wood confirmed to BBC Wales on Monday that a deal had been done with Labour to back the budget.\nIt could be the case that Labour will need to fund one or more of Plaid's manifesto commitments as the price for its support.\nThe \"compact\" agreement which saw Plaid back Carwyn Jones's return as first minister listed a set of priorities where the two parties had something of a consensus.\nThey included childcare and the delivery of new all-age apprenticeships, and increases to the number of healthcare workers and GPs.",

    "document": "He began broadcasting in the days of skiffle and was still at the microphone in the second decade of the 21st Century.\nMany of the most enduring acts in pop history kick-started their careers on one of his many radio shows.\nAnd, as presenter of Thank Your Lucky Stars, he introduced the Beatles and the Rolling Stones to a television audience.\nBrian Matthew was born in Coventry on 17 September 1928 into a musical family. His mother sang professionally while his father was the conductor of the local silver band.\nHis radio career began when he was serving with the Army in post-war Germany where he worked as a programme presenter and newsreader on  the British Forces Network, which broadcast to troops serving abroad.\nHe also developed something of a talent for acting and on leaving the Army, he went to Rada, securing a number of roles with the Old Vic Company. It was there that he met his wife, Pamela, whom he married in 1951.\nThere was a short time with Radio Netherlands Worldwide, the Dutch English language service, before he returned to the UK and took up a job as a milkman in his home city.\nMatthew was back behind a microphone in 1954 when the BBC recruited him as an announcer and producer. One of the programmes he hosted was Saturday Skiffle Club, later renamed Saturday Club, which went out on the BBC Light Programme on Saturday mornings.\nThe BBC virtually ignored the boom in popular music in the 1950s and Matthew's show quickly found an appreciative teenage audience.\nSkiffle, which was based on acoustic guitars and a variety of home-made instruments including tea chests and washboards, had a fleeting moment of fame with artists such as Lonnie Donegan, before it was swept away by rock and roll.\nWith bands such as Bill Hailey and the Comets from the US, and up-and-coming British performers like Adam Faith and the Shadows, the demand for pop music grew and Matthew's show was extended to two hours from the original 30 minutes.\nThe programme brought a British audience the music of a host of US stars, including Gene Vincent, the Everly Brothers and Jerry Lee Lewis alongside emerging British talent. In later years the show would highlight performances by The Beatles, The Searchers and Manfred Mann.\nIn 1960, the BBC launched a Sunday morning show called Easy Beat and Matthew was drafted in to present that as well. By now he was the authentic voice of the pop music explosion that came to dominate the 1960s.\nA year later his audience finally put a face to the voice when he was recruited to present ITV's new pop show, Thank Your Lucky Stars. It featured bands such as The Beatles and the Rolling Stones miming to their latest single.  A guest DJ and three teenagers would also review new releases. This latter section of the show introduced Janice Nicholls whose \"Oi'll give it foive\" delivered in her strong Black Country accent, passed into folklore.\nBy the mid-1960s, the BBC's pop offering was looking rather dated alongside the competition from a fleet of pirate radio ships scattered around the coast of the UK. When the BBC finally caught up in 1967, with the launch of Radio 1, Easy Beat was dropped. Meanwhile, Matthew, who was approaching his 40s,  found himself dropped from Saturday Club in favour of former pirate DJ, Keith Skues.\nIn 1972 Matthew narrated a 12-part documentary for Radio 2 entitled The Beatles Story which was later repeated on 6 Music.\nMatthew later appeared on Radio 1 presenting My Top 12, a programme on which a guest star would be interviewed about his or her career and select 12 favourite tracks to make up an imaginary album.\nGuests reflected the whole range of popular music and included Brian Ferry, Keith Emerson, Joni Mitchell and Neil Diamond. Matthew also presented a regular easy listening show on weekday evenings for radio and, in 1978, began hosting the Radio 2 arts show Round Midnight.\nIn 1990, he took over Sounds of the 60s, the Radio 2 show with which he would always be indelibly linked. It gained a huge and appreciative audience of people who had been teenagers in the 1960s, as well as their children, tuning in to hear the opening bars of Foot Tapper, the Shadows recording that was the programme's theme tune.\nIn 2008, Matthew won a Sony Gold Award \"in recognition of a truly outstanding contribution to UK radio\".\nApart from a couple of breaks because of illness, Matthew continued to present the show until, in January 2017, the BBC announced that he was standing down because of ill-health and that his place would be taken by Tony Blackburn.\nThe Corporation found itself on the end of a backlash from loyal listeners and from Matthew himself, who attacked the BBC's handling of the matter.\n\"I was ready and willing and able to go back,\" he said, \"and they just said they are going to put the programme in the hands of other people.\n\"I enjoyed doing the show very much. I did it for 25 years. I feel very disconcerted, I must say.\"\nHe presented his final proper show on 25 February 2017 although a repeat of an earlier programme, with new links, was broadcast on 6 March.\nHe signed off his last broadcast in typical style. \"This is your old mate, Brian Matthew, saying that's your lot for this week. See you soon.\"",

    "document": "The Sana news agency said the military had \"restored security and stability to the neighbourhood of Khalidiya\".\nActivists reported clashes in Khalidiya on Monday morning, but said that most of the area was under army control.\nThe announcement comes a month after troops launched an offensive to oust rebels from Syria's third largest city.\nHoms has been one of the focuses of a two-year nationwide uprising against President Bashar al-Assad, in which the UN says more than 100,000 people have died.\nCorrespondents say the capture of Khalidiya would add further impetus to the counter-offensive by government troops and their allies, which saw the nearby town of Qusair fall in June.\nBy Paul WoodBBC News, Beirut\nThe fall of Khalidiya had been expected. One Western diplomat said he had been told recently by a Free Syrian Army commander that it was not possible to get any ammunition or other supplies in. Cut off from help, it was only a matter of time, perhaps, for the rebels.\nThere are other parts of Homs still, just, in rebel hands. But if they, along with Khalidiya, do fall, Homs will become just the latest in a line of regime victories on the battlefield.\nThe regime's forces have been steadily picking off some of the villages around Homs. Two months ago, with the help of Hezbollah, they recaptured the town of Qusair. The government has halted - if not quite turned around - a rebel advance on Damascus. Sources close to the regime say an offensive is also planned for the northern city of Aleppo.\nAfter Khalidiya, Syria conflict goes on\nIn pictures: Khalidiya devastation\nOn Monday, an unnamed army officer told Syrian state television: \"Today, we can report having complete control of the area of Khalidiya.\"\n\"That was a victory of all our fighters and the whole Syrian Army and especially our dear leader, Bashar al-Assad. And God willing, we will get rid of the terrorists in the entire country and the future will be free of killings and under the control of the army.\"\nHowever, UK-based activist group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights cast doubt on the claim.\nWhile the group acknowledged that government forces were in control of most of Khalidiya, it said fighting was continuing on Monday.\n\"Clashes took place between rebels and regime forces, supported by Hezbollah and National Defence Forces, in the southern parts of the Khalidiya neighbourhood,\" it said.\n\"Regime forces are bombarding parts, and military reinforcements are arriving as advancing regime forces try to establish full control.\"\nOpposition activists told the AFP news agency that about 90% of Khalidiya was now controlled by the army. One told the Associated Press that the battle for the district was \"almost over\".\nOn Sunday, the Arabic TV station al-Mayadeen, which is seen as close to the Syrian government, broadcast what it said was footage of Khalidiya, showing heavily damaged buildings and piles of rubble.\nIt also showed pictures of the interior of the historic Khaled bin Walid mosque, a focal point for anti-government protesters. Troops reportedly seized it on Saturday, days after activists accused them of firing shells at the tomb of Khaled bin Walid, a revered figure in Islam.\nOnly the Old City of Homs and a few other districts are still held by the opposition. On Monday, government jets bombed the Bab Hud district of the Old City, just south of Khalidiya, according to the Syrian Observatory.",

    "document": "Every owner of a gadget piloted via a touchscreen has spent time rubbing it with a tissue, a cloth or a sleeve gripped round the heel of the hand to banish those unsightly marks.\nIt's not that human fingers are filthy. Those smears come about thanks to a mix of physiology and good grooming habits, said Steve Block, an electronics industry scientist at Dow Corning, which makes coatings that get applied to touchable screens.\n\"There's a whole range of things that can contaminate those surfaces,\" he said. \"There are natural oils on the fingers as well as the lotions people put their hands. Then there's cosmetics and the times when you hold your telephone up to your ear and it's sweaty.\"\nSmall wonder then that the sight of those smears is unsettling.\nThankfully, there is no reason to fret, as those smears are safe if your touchscreen gadget is kept just for you, said Prof  Charles Gerba, a microbiologist at the University of Arizona.\n\"Touchscreens are a source of a wide range of microbes, but not much of an issue if you do not share it among other people - since, if you are the only one using it, it's only your germs,\" he told the BBC.\nSadly, that is not the case when those touchscreens are put to more promiscuous use, such as in a supermarket at the self-checkout, by patients in a doctor's waiting room or in a family that passes the gadget around.\nStudies by Prof Gerba and colleagues have shown how important an infection vector touchscreens can be when used by lots of people.\n\"We have traced the spread of MRSA skin infection among teenagers that shared a cell phone,\" he said. \"You will find MRSA on touchscreens on self-checkout screens in grocery stores in the US.\"\nTouchscreens can be \"reservoirs of opportunistic pathogens\", said Prof Gerba in a small-scale study that uncovered MRSA, E. coli and C. difficile and many others on screens in hospitals and supermarkets.\nIt is worth keeping those surfaces clean, said Prof Gerba, even if the chances of getting ill are pretty low.\n\"For viruses it can take as little one to make you ill, but this varies a lot depending on the organisms. Some bacteria take 100,000 cells to cause illness, others a few hundred,\" he said. \"It just depends if you come across the right organisms at the right time.\"\nThe study was carried out to test the best way of keeping those screens clean and killing off the bad bugs. The good news is that wipes impregnated with sodium hypochlorite (bleach), did a good job of disinfecting the screens. However, regularly wiping with bleach might not be a solution that domestic owners of very shiny, very expensive gadgets would favour.\nThankfully, other fixes are at hand.\nTo begin with, said Mr Block, screen makers are constantly refining the materials and coatings that make gadgets easy to wipe and keep clean. Those transparent coverings are glass, he said, but of a very particular type. Typically, he said, they and the coatings covering them are engineered to the most minute scale.\n\"They are made of very specialised molecules that are designed for these type of applications,\" said Mr Block. The silicone coatings that are now becoming standard are far more resistant to the secretions and substances that can end up on a touchscreen.\nAlso, said Mr Block, they are tougher and ensure a screen will stay responsive years after it is bought.\nThere are other innovations that might help too. Japanese materials company Toray has come up with a coating that, it claims, repels up to 50% more of the oil and other residues found on fingers. In addition, once applied, the coating dries into millions of tiny wrinkles that help hide smudges to help screens stay sharp.\nThe fourth generation of Gorilla Glass, which is used on many touchscreen gadgets, will include an antibacterial coating that can kill those pesky bugs by themselves. That coating is likely to start being used within the next couple of years.\nThen there is the work of scientists at Harvard University's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, who turned to a carnivorous plant to develop their screen coating. They found that the walls of the pitcher plant are slippery because they are covered with tiny bumps that trap water. Insects that can easily walk on walls struggle to make any progress on this surface because it repels the oils on their feet.\nBy mimicking this surface and applying an ultra-thin layer of lubricant, the researchers created a surface inimical to bodily substances. The work is still in the lab but is more evidence that those screens are only going to get harder to smear and easier to use.\n\"Any dirt is a barrier between user experience and a display,\" said Mr Block.",

    "document": "Another measure of success in Canada will be the crowd for the first Women's FA Cup final to be held at Wembley on Saturday.\nWe've already seen record crowds at Women's Super League games since we've arrived home and about 30,000 tickets have been sold for the game between my team Chelsea and Notts County, which will set a new benchmark.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIf we see those numbers, I see no reason why the FA Cup final cannot be played at Wembley every year. Women's football in England is now worthy of that stage and as one of the first two teams to play this historic occasion, we will be proud to be part of another pioneering moment.\nIn the build-up to the game, some of my team-mates have been asking me about playing at Wembley, having played there for England against Germany last November and while representing Great Britain at the London 2012 Olympics.\nI can only say that it is a unique, out-of-body experience to play in front of so many people. It's a feeling that never gets old and we will be going to Wembley before Saturday so that those new to it can get a feel of the iconic 90,000-seat stadium.\nIn attempting to win Chelsea's first piece of silverware, it's the biggest game in the club's history, but one thing I've been telling them is we have to play the game and not the occasion.\nI wouldn't care if it was being played in a local park in Wembley, the most important thing is to win.\nWith Chelsea's men's team also playing at Wembley the following day when the Premier League champions take on FA Cup winners Arsenal in the Community Shield, we want to make it a historic weekend.\nThere are many players in our team who have won the FA Cup before, including myself.\nThe first time was in 2005 with Charlton when I scored the winner against Everton and in 2012 I was part of the Birmingham team which beat Chelsea on penalties following a 2-2 draw.\nIn our dressing room we have midfielder Katie Chapman, who has won the FA Cup eight times, and Gilly Flaherty, who has won it five times, so we are not lacking pedigree.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nBut having missed out on WSL so narrowly last season [on goal difference to Liverpool], it's fair to say that this could mean more because of the journey we have been on together.\nDespite losing our last two league games, we aren't panicking. We have strong characters in the dressing room and the belief that got us to the FA Cup final and saw us go unbeaten in 13 matches this year.\nThere has been plenty of talk about the fact that our unbeaten start to the league season has come to an end.\nIt would have been nice to hold onto that record, but the WSL is a very competitive league and every team in it has dropped points. We were the last to do so. We didn't play well in a 4-0 loss at Sunderland but the promoted side are now top of the league and our defeat by Manchester City last Sunday came courtesy of a very fortunate winner. Despite the result, our performance was pleasing.\nWe are a point off the top with five games left and to be in that position in such a competitive season is positive.\nOur focus is now on Saturday and we are confident we can win.\nAnother positive from the World Cup has been the boost to crowds in the WSL.\nThe first weekend after we arrived back saw record numbers for Manchester City, while 2,061 watched Liverpool beat Arsenal, and more than 1,200 saw us beat Bristol.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThree weeks after our return, the bounce has lasted. Our first home defeat in more than 18 months by Manchester City was watched by a club-record 1,857 at Staines FC.\nThose numbers are a credit to marketing staff at WSL clubs and the players, who are obviously putting on a good show in order to entice supporters back. The time we spend with fans immediately after games also helps too, I think.\nThe test now comes when the Premier League starts on 8 August.\nWith the Continental Cup now under way again, our season doesn't end until October, so hopefully the upsurge in attendances will continue and women's football will still very much be something people want to watch.\nEngland and Chelsea forward Eniola Aluko was speaking to BBC Sport's Alistair Magowan.",

Today's Christmas shoppers are unlikely to find raw meat but instead gift shops, pubs, restaurants and the occasional film crew (it has been used as a location for several movies including the first Harry Potter film).\nRegent Street claims to be the first central London street to have had a Christmas lights display, having first put them on show in 1954.\nThis year's theme has been called The Spirit of Christmas, which organisers say is a reminder of the street's \"festive heritage\".\nSelfridges on Oxford Street has been a popular destination for Christmas shoppers for more than a century.\nThe store was opened in 1909 by Harry Gordon Selfridge after he arrived in the capital from Chicago.\nThe outbreak of World War Two did not stop some Oxford Street stores marking Christmas.\nIn 1939, sandbags were placed around the display windows of Selfridges to protect the glass against feared bombing raids.\nThe Christmas tree in Trafalgar Square has been given to London by the people of Norway since 1947, as a gift for Britain's support during World War Two.\nThe layout of the square may have changed slightly but the tree remains a popular destination for tourists.\nIn 1922, Christmas mail from across the UK was piled up on the platforms at Paddington Station before being delivered to addresses across the capital.\nThe same platforms have been used by travellers this year to make their way out of the city before the station shuts for several days for engineering works.\nPetticoat Lane Market in the East End is thought to be one of Britain's oldest surviving markets, having first begun operating in the 1750s.\nIt is best known for selling clothing and leather goods, and while it may appear to have been a lot busier in December 1938, it still attracts shoppers - particularly for the main market on Sundays.\nIn the heart of the West End, Carnaby Street found fame when it became the centre of \"Swinging London\" in the 1960s.\nThe Christmas lights in 1967 reflected this, as does this year's display which has been inspired by the V&A museum's new exhibition \"You Say You Want A Revolution?

Beyond the barricades, ringed by policemen, the Delhi chief minister and his cabinet are sitting in protest, just by the parliament and federal government buildings.\nShielded from the cold and rain by supporters, he takes time to speak to the media, sign government files and preside over a cabinet meeting. Security is extra-tight because India's annual Republic Day parade is just days away.\nThe anniversary showcases India's military might - even now soldiers in ceremonial uniforms are going through their paces just a short distance away.\nTension is rising because the streets around the venue have to be cleared for security reasons ahead of the parade. At the moment, though, they are full of protesters who show no sign of leaving.\n\"Police [are] carrying people selectively in to the bus and beating them up. Is this called democracy?\"\nNevertheless, Mr Kejriwal and his cabinet ministers are continuing to conduct daily administrative business on the streets.\nMr Kejriwal took the helm as Delhi's chief minister last month on a ticket to fight corruption and conduct politics differently, calling his party a \"new broom\".\nBut he quickly became embroiled in a row over policing after one of his ministers accused officers of failing to crack down on an alleged drugs and prostitution ring - the police deny these claims.\nDelhi's police force is run by the federal government and the impromptu protest began on Monday when Mr Kejriwal was prevented from going to the home minister's office to demand the suspension of several officers.\nIt started with an incident which threatened to become a diplomatic issue, pitching the Aam Aadmi Party, the police and members of Delhi's African community at loggerheads.\nLast Wednesday Mr Kejriwal's Law Minister, Somnath Bharti, and various party supporters allegedly confronted four Ugandan women in a Delhi neighbourhood accusing them of prostitution.\nA row erupted when police refused to search a nearby house for evidence of a suspected drugs and prostitution ring because they did not have a warrant.\nMr Bharti and Aam Aadmi Party supporters were accused of threatening and intimidating the women, forcing their way into homes and making racist remarks - they deny these allegations.\nIndian Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde says a judicial inquiry into the role of the police has been ordered and Mr Kejriwal \"should wait for its result\" before protesting.\nBut Mr Kejriwal says his protest encompasses more grievances than just that case.\nHis party has also condemned the police for their handling of other cases, such as the recent alleged gang-rape of a Danish woman in Delhi and the case of a woman who was reportedly killed over a demand for dowry by her in-laws.",

They then monitored the change in the height of the overlying water during the course of 201 days.\nWhat the scientists saw was a clear spike in the data twice a day - the result of the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun. But they could also tease out a second signal stemming from the way water rises and falls as a result of the tilting of the land. And, in fact, the latter effect sits on top of the first and is responsible for most of the amplitude change.\nThe team says the measurement was made to an accuracy of just 0.1 mm over the loch's 35 km length.\n\"We had to extract the tidal signal and get rid of all the noise. This involved very high precision,\" explained David Pugh.\n\"For example, the loch surface itself goes up and down every day by four centimetres just due to the pump storage scheme for hydroelectric generation, and we have to pull out a very small signal within that.\n\"The holy grail would be to learn from the effects of the tides something about the Earth's crust.

Its recommendations include:\nA Department of Health spokesman said it was \"committed\" to protecting the rights of vulnerable people, which is why it commissioned the review.\n\"We thank the Law Commission for its detailed work, and will be responding to these constructive recommendations in due course.\"\nThe Department of Health said it provided \u00c2\u00a325m of additional funding for 2015/16 to local authorities to support them in managing the increase in DoLS applications.",

    "document": "On that Sunday morning, on 27 November 1994, Celtic awaited but also the sense that a side assembled from youth players and journeymen could achieve something remarkable.\nAs the squad boarded the team bus, nobody was allowed to sit at the first table on the right-hand side of the aisle. \"That is where we are going to put the Cup on the way back,\" the captain, Gordon Dalziel, told his team-mates. There was no scoffing.\nThis was an unconventional team, but their maverick nature was vital to their success. Twenty years on, it seems no less momentous.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nRaith Rovers, a team from the second tier of Scottish football that had never won a major knockout competition and had been put together with \u00a3215,000 in transfer fees, against Celtic, one of the most storied and successful clubs in British football, a team that was built to achieve glory, at a cost of \u00a35.17m.\nThe details of Raith's victory on penalties are now part of the fabric of Scottish football. The underdogs scored first, Celtic fought back and led with six minutes left, only for Dalziel to equalise when he sent the ball into the net from close range with his nose.\nExtra-time passed and then both sides scored their first five spot kicks. Jason Rowbotham, now a firefighter in Plymouth, struck the first of the sudden death penalties and sent it past Gordon Marshall. Then Paul McStay stepped up.\nAs the Celtic midfielder walked forward, Nicholl turned to his assistant, Martin Harvey, and said that Raith Rovers were one kick away from European football.\nMcStay was idolised, smoothly accomplished and capable of rising above the clutter of so many Scottish football games. He was also the captain and this was the trophy that was expected to signal that the rebuilding work of the Fergus McCann era had been worthwhile. \"Unthinkable, surely,\" said Jock Brown, the television commentator, \"for the skipper to miss.\"\nHis spot-kick was saved by the Raith Rovers goalkeeper, Scott Thomson, sparking triumphant scenes.\n\"The aftermath was chaotic, Thommo made the save and we all pretty much just bolted in every direction, towards the fans, to each other, to the gaffer,\" recalled Stephen McAnespie, the Raith Rovers right-back.\nThere was never any hope of confining the joy. The unorthodoxy of Raith was an essential quality.\nDuring pre-season training camps in Northern Ireland, Nicholl would often allow his players to have nights out socialising and cans of Guinness would sometimes be brought out on the team bus after pre-season friendlies. Nicholl was not lax, he just understood that he had drawn together a group of hardworking players who he could trust to be fully committed in training and in games - and that team bonding was also vital to maximising their potential.\n\"We achieved a lot of good things in that period, winning the [old First Division], getting into Europe, winning the Cup,\" said McAnespie. \"We were technically a good side, we played the ball on the floor, we were an aggressive, attack-minded team.\n\"We had a great blend of youth and experience through the middle of the park with [Steve] Crawford, [Colin] Cameron, [Jason] Dair, [Danny] Lennon and [Gordon] Dalziel and [Ally] Graham up front.\n\"The camaraderie was huge for us. We mixed a lot outside the changing-room, whether it was golf or a night out after a game, we had a lot of good characters and Jimmy Nic had a lot to do with that. He knew the value of a close-knit dressing-room and was a big part of the banter, but he also knew when the time was right to get tuned in and focus.\n\"Believe it or not, we felt we could win the game before we kicked off. That was probably because we had some of us young guys that were kind of fearless and a bit naive to the magnitude of the occasion, which obviously worked out for us.\"\nRaith spent the night before the game at a hotel in Erskine, where Nicholl told the players what the starting line-up would be and then allowed them some time to relax. As they were playing darts and cards, a waiter arrived with six pints of Guinness and six pints of lager, ordered just to calm the players down. They were irrepressible, though, and the bus journey to Ibrox ended with the players - many of them Celtic fans - loudly singing Tina Turner's \"Simply The Best\", a song that was regularly played at Ibrox.\nRovers had the home dressing-room and they had also been granted a training session the morning before on the Ibrox pitch, due to Nicholl's connections with Rangers, his former club. In the dressing-room, the players also found a bag of studs that were right for the surface, left by the Rangers kit man.\nIn the tunnel at Ibrox before kick-off, the Raith players were joking around while the Celtic players looked grimly determined. The club had not won any major trophies in five years and the manager, Tommy Burns, was under pressure to deliver the trophy. He still found time to shake Dalziel's hand in the tunnel and wish him all the best.\nBack in the dressing-room after the penalty shootout, as the Celtic players tried to come to terms with the defeat, the Raith team were joined by some guests.\n\"The first two people in behind us were John Greig and Ally McCoist,\" McAnespie said. \"They gave us cases of Rangers label champagne. I grabbed two bottles and went straight to the front entrance, still in my kit and boots, and my family were standing right there. I handed my dad the bottles and gave them a hug and got dragged back in by the security.\n\"I thought the crowd was going to rush the door. We went back to the hotel in Kirkcaldy, where we were met by thousands of Raith fans at the hotel with pipers, which we never expected.\n\"We celebrated for a while, [but] a lot of the guys were so physically and emotionally drained that a lot of us ended up in bed early, shattered. Well, a little tipsy and shattered.\"\nWhen Nicholl had arrived at Raith as manager, on 27 November 1990, the team was mostly part-time and the players washed their own kit. Following the League Cup win, and the subsequent foray into Europe that ended with a tie against Bayern Munich, Raith were able to build two stands at Stark's Park.\n\"It's nice to re-live it all,\" said McAnespie, who is now a coach in New Orleans, \"especially with the other players, because at times we will remind each other about something that we had forgotten about after 20 years.\"",

The latter is due to make its next supply run in June.\nAs long as it keeps working well, ISS officials in Houston and Moscow will not be unduly concerned.\nIf, for some reason, supplies did become marginal, the space agencies would simply reduce the size of the normal six-person crew until matters could be improved.\nProgress was to deliver food, water, fuel, oxygen and clothing to the crew of six people on the space station that orbits about 420km (250 miles) above Earth.\nEven after Progress' loss, the astronauts have enough supplies to keep them going until the next expected delivery on 19 June.\nA Roscosmos spokesman told Reuters that the loss was valued at 2.59 billion roubles ($50.7m, \u00c2\u00a332.9m).",

Brent crude oil has now dipped below $50 a barrel for the first time since May 2009 and US crude is down to below $48 a barrel.\nThe reasons for this change are twofold - weak demand in many countries due to insipid economic growth, coupled with surging US production.\nAdded to this is the fact that the oil cartel Opec is determined not to cut production as a way to prop up prices.\nSo who are some of the winners and losers?\nRussia is one of the world's largest oil producers, and its dramatic interest rate hike to 17% in support of its troubled rouble underscores how heavily its economy depends on energy revenues, with oil and gas accounting for 70% of export incomes.\nRussia loses about $2bn in revenues for every dollar fall in the oil price, and the World Bank has warned that Russia's economy would shrink by at least 0.7% in 2015 if oil prices do not recover.\nDespite this, Russia has confirmed it will not cut production to shore up oil prices.\n\"If we cut, the importer countries will increase their production and this will mean a loss of our niche market,\" said Energy Minister Alexander Novak.\nFalling oil prices, coupled with western sanctions over Russia's support for separatists in eastern Ukraine have hit the country hard.\nThe government has cut its growth forecast for 2015, predicting that the economy will sink into recession.\nFormer finance minister, Alexei Kudrin, said the currency's fall was not just a reaction to lower oil prices and western sanctions, \"but also [a show of] distrust to the economic policies of the government\".\nGiven the pressures facing Moscow now, some economists expect further measures to shore up the currency.\n\"We think capital controls as a policy measure cannot be off the table now,\" said Luis Costa, a senior analyst at Citi.\nWhile President Putin is not using the word \"crisis\", Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has been more forthright on Russia's economic problems.\n\"Frankly, we, strictly speaking, have not fully recovered from the crisis of 2008,\" he said in a recent interview.\nBecause of the twin impact of falling oil prices and sanctions, he said the government had had to cut spending. \"We had to abandon a number of programmes and make certain sacrifices.\"\nRussia's interest rate rise may also bring its own problems, as high rates can choke economic growth by making it harder for businesses to borrow and spend.\nVenezuela is one of the world's largest oil exporters, but thanks to economic mismanagement it was already finding it difficult to pay its way even before the oil price started falling.\nInflation is running at about 60% and the economy is teetering on the brink of recession. The need for spending cuts is clear, but the government faces difficult choices.\nThe country already has some of the world's cheapest petrol prices - fuel subsidies cost Caracas about $12.5bn a year - but President Maduro has ruled out subsidy cuts and higher petrol prices.\n\"I've considered as head of state, that the moment has not arrived,\" he said. \"There's no rush, we're not going to throw more gasoline on the fire that already exists with speculation and induced inflation.\"\nThe government's caution is understandable. A petrol price rise in 1989 saw widespread riots that left hundreds dead.\nSaudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter and Opec's most influential member, could support global oil prices by cutting back its own production, but there is little sign it wants to do this.\nThere could be two reasons - to try to instil some discipline among fellow Opec oil producers, and perhaps to put the US's burgeoning shale oil and gas industry under pressure.\nAlthough Saudi Arabia needs oil prices to be around $85 in the longer term, it has deep pockets with a reserve fund of some $700bn - so can withstand lower prices for some time.\n\"In terms of production and pricing of oil by Middle East producers, they are beginning to recognise the challenge of US production,\" says Robin Mills, Manaar Energy's head of consulting.\nIf a period of lower prices were to force some higher cost producers to shut down, then Riyadh might hope to pick up market share in the longer run.\nHowever, there is also recent history behind Riyadh's unwillingness to cut production. In the 1980s the country did cut production significantly in a bid to boost prices, but it had little effect and it also badly affected the Saudi economy.\nAlongside Saudi Arabia, Gulf producers such as the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have also amassed considerable foreign currency reserves, which means that they could run deficits for several years if necessary.\nOther Opec members such as Iran, Iraq and Nigeria, with greater domestic budgetary demands because of their large population sizes in relation to their oil revenues, have less room for manoeuvre.\nThey have combined foreign currency reserves of less than $200bn, and are already under pressure from increased US competition.\nNigeria, which is Africa's biggest oil producer, has seen growth in the rest of its economy but despite this it remains heavily oil-dependent. Energy sales account for up to 80% of all government revenue and more than 90% of the country's exports.\nThe war in Syria and Iraq has also seen Isis, or Islamic State, capturing oil wells. It is estimated it is making about $3m a day through black market sales - and undercutting market prices by selling at a significant discount - around $30-60 a barrel.\n\"The growth of oil production in North America, particularly in the US, has been staggering,\" says Columbia University's Jason Bordoff.\nSpeaking to BBC World Service's World Business Report, he said that US oil production levels were at their highest in almost 30 years.\nIt has been this growth in US energy production, where gas and oil is extracted from shale formations using hydraulic fracturing or fracking, that has been one of the main drivers of lower oil prices.\n\"Shale has essentially severed the linkage between geopolitical turmoil in the Middle East, and oil price and equities,\" says Seth Kleinman, head of energy strategy at Citi.\nEven though many US shale oil producers have far higher costs than conventional rivals, many need to carry on pumping to generate at least some revenue stream to pay off debts and other costs.\nWith Europe's flagging economies characterised by low inflation and weak growth, any benefits of lower prices would be welcomed by beleaguered governments.\nA 10% fall in oil prices should lead to a 0.1% increase in economic output, say some. In general consumers benefit through lower energy prices, but eventually low oil prices do erode the conditions that brought them about.\nChina, which is set to become the largest net importer of oil, should gain from falling prices. However, lower oil prices won't fully offset the far wider effects of a slowing economy.\nJapan imports nearly all of the oil it uses. But lower prices are a mixed blessing because high energy prices had helped to push inflation higher, which has been a key part of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's growth strategy to combat deflation.\nIndia imports 75% of its oil, and analysts say falling oil prices will ease its current account deficit. At the same time, the cost of India's fuel subsidies could fall by $2.5bn this year - but only if oil prices stay low.",
    "summary": "Global oil prices have fallen sharply over the past seven months, leading to significant revenue shortfalls in many energy exporting nations, while consumers in many importing countries are likely to have to pay less to heat their homes or drive their cars.",

    "document": "\"Is it Hillary Clinton?\"\nDaniel Aston, 20, is puzzling over a picture of a woman who looms very large in the history of his home town.\n\"It's Margaret something,\" offers 19-year-old Andrew Jones. Only Liam Foster-Jones, of the three unemployed friends, seems certain about who the imperious features and swept-back helmet of hair might belong to.\n\"It's Margaret Thatcher,\" he says.\nThe name doesn't seem to mean much to them.\nIt would have been a different story 36 years ago, when the Thatcher government closed Consett's steel works, with the loss of 3,700 jobs.\nThe devastation inflicted on this remote town high on the edge of the Pennines, where unemployment soared to 36%, made the national news and became a symbol of the harsh medicine the Thatcher government thought it had to administer to Britain's heavy industries.\nIt sowed the seeds for the electoral wipe out the Conservatives would experience across large parts of Northern England and Scotland, which it still trying to recover from today.\nThatcher and \"the Tories\" remain dirty words to the former steel workers in Consett but few young people I spoke to could recognise her and those that did regarded her as a distant historical figure.\n\"I don't really have an opinion [about her] but my dad doesn't like her because she shut down the steel works,\" said 20-year-old Adam Stokoe.\n\"So my dad has strong opinions about that. I'm not from that time period so I don't really think about it that way. I only think about now. What's going to benefit me.\"\nConsett has never had a Conservative MP but the Tory vote held up surprisingly well in other parts of the North-East while Thatcher was in power. In 1983, the party took 34% of North East votes, and had five MPs.\nIt was only after she left office that anti-Tory attitudes really hardened, with the party's share of the vote slumping by 10%. It currently has just three MPs in the region.\nTheresa May is attempting to change that on 8 June and has urged traditional Labour supporters to \"lend\" her their vote.\nShe will have experienced at first hand how difficult it is to break the voting habits of a lifetime in this part of the world when she stood for election in North West Durham in 1992.\n(By a strange coincidence, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron was also standing for Parliament for the first time that year in the same constituency.)\nThey still remember Mrs May at Consett Working Men's Club - because, claims the barman, they wouldn't let her through the door.\nIt had nothing to do with her politics, he adds, it's just that the club is one of a tiny handful left in the UK that does not admit women.\n\"Your wife can't chase you in here,\" says one regular, looking up from his racing form. He doesn't want to talk about politics.\nMrs May won 28% of the vote in North West Durham - a score that has not been beaten by a Conservative candidate there since - but although one local poll put the party in with a chance of winning on 8 June it is not high on their target list.\nThere was certainly little enthusiasm for Mrs May's brand of Conservatism in the town's Steel Club, although the lifelong Labour voters I spoke to were equally scathing about their traditional party of choice.\n\"I don't like Jeremy Corbyn. He hasn't got a brain in his head as far as I'm concerned,\" said Christopher Bell, a 69-year-old retired steel worker and club steward.\nHe and his partner, Linda, voted for Brexit in last year's referendum and are worried about the strain they say is being placed on local services by East European immigrants.\nLinda, who voted UKIP in 2015, said she would not return to the Labour fold until the party was led by \"somebody that's going to stand up for English people, working class people - because the Conservatives like the rich and they like to keep them rich\".\nThirty miles south in Darlington, a constituency with a narrower Labour majority of just over 3,000, people seemed more receptive to the Conservative message.\nThe town has had a Tory MP before - Defence Secretary Michael Fallon in the 1980s - and the party has hopes of retaking the seat on 8 June.\n\"I will vote for Theresa May. Not necessarily because she's a Conservative but I think she's the only person for the job. Given the other options,\" says Alex Blackham, owner of a cafe in the town's indoor market.\n\"If she'd been Labour or an independent then I would have been voting for her as a person. I think that's what politics comes down to sometimes.\"\nClive Hinson, a 59-year-old assembly line worker who was about to tuck into one of Mr Blackham's full English breakfasts, blames Thatcher for the closure of the dump truck factory he worked at in the 1980s.\nBut he adds: \"Funnily enough, I'll be voting Conservative. Because I think Corbyn is a waste of time.\n\"He can't give a definitive answer on defence. He's got all these plans for spending loads of money but the figures just don't add up....so much though I don't want to vote Conservative that's the way I'm voting.\"\nHe says the North East has \"forgiven but not forgotten\" Thatcher, comparing the reconciliation process to what happened in Northern Ireland or South Africa. Like Mr Blackham he voted for Brexit in last year's EU referendum.\nMost of the older working class people I spoke to - the traditional bedrock of Labour support in the area - needed no prompting to criticise what they saw as Jeremy Corbyn's lack of leadership ability and charisma.\nHe seemed to go over much better with younger, more cosmopolitan voters.\n\"I would vote Corbyn all day every day,\" said Stephen Lock, who runs a comic book stall in the covered market with wife June.\n\"He's such a man of the people by the looks of it. He's looking after the general working people. He seems to have great ideas. They may be a little outdated in the modern day, but he's not the person they're painting him out to be. They are trying to make him out to be weak and I don't think he is.\"\nThe couple returned from 13 years in France, where they had a gardening business, after the Brexit vote. \"We thought we had better come back and do something else here. It's affected us quite heavily,\" said Stephen.\nThey are torn between voting Labour and Liberal Democrats - and are not impressed by what they see as the disloyalty of Labour MPs who openly criticise their leader.\n\"The Labour Party is shooting itself in the foot by not acting and standing as one,\" said June.\n\"You have got career politicians that are more concerned about their own personal interests than their constituents.\"\nThere also appeared to real enthusiasm for Corbyn among Darlington's student population, who blame the media for portraying him in a negative light.\n\"You don't see a lot of coverage of, like, nice things about him,\" said 18-year-old Emily Frewin. \"But when you actually read into it he is a nice person.\"\nTheresa May avoids talking to the voters, she adds, but \"he seems like he wants to talk to everybody, not just the rich people\".\n\"He does seem to be getting slandered quite a lot,\" agrees 20-year-old software development student Josh Walker, \"when he's trying to fight for us.\"\nIf the Thatcher factor was ever a major impediment to a Tory revival in the North East, it has undoubtedly faded with time.\nThe party's tactic of detaching Theresa May's name - it was emblazoned across the battle bus she toured the North-East in - from the Conservative brand appears to be working with some voters, who might feel a little queasy at the prospect of putting their cross next to a Tory candidate.\nSome told me they had flirted with a Conservative vote, only to think better of it - Mrs May's support for a free vote on fox hunting, not an issue that has exactly dominated the airwaves, was mentioned by several people as a reason for not switching to the Tories.\nAnd there will always be some who will never forget, or forgive. Like the Darlington woman who greeted Theresa May's name with a horrified cry of \"she's another Maggie Thatcher!\".\nBut on the basis of this highly unscientific sample, Thatcher is no longer the bogey figure she was and Labour can no longer rely on the loyalty of its traditional support base.",

    "document": "But the inspiration for this scheme to improve health services in Zambia began in very low-tech and unhappy circumstances.\nHuw Jones, working in Zambia as a safari guide, was driving a Land Rover along a road in a remote part of the country.\nHe saw a trail of blood in the road, and his first reaction was that it might have come from an animal killed by a lion.\nBut he came across a couple on a bike - the man riding and the woman carried on the handlebars.\nShe was pregnant and bleeding heavily and they had been cycling for hours with the aim of reaching the nearest hospital, almost 60 miles away.\nThe woman was in a great deal of pain and her husband seemed to be in a state of shock, says Mr Jones.\n\"In the heat and that terrain, they were desperate,\" he says.\nMr Jones stopped to pick them up and drive them.\nBut the woman was already weak and died in the back of the Land Rover before they could reach anyone who could give them medical help.\n\"It affected me quite deeply. I wondered if I could do anything,\" says Mr Jones.\nIt was an awful example of the lack of medical provision for rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa - and, he says, he has come across too many deaths that could have been avoided with better care.\nZambia has about 1,600 doctors for a population of 14 million, and two-thirds of these are working in towns and cities, while most of the country's population is in the countryside.\nIt means access to good quality health care is often difficult if not impossible.\nWhen Mr Jones returned to the UK, he began to develop a project to fill some of these gaps.\nHe set up the Virtual Doctors charity, based in Brighton, which uses the expertise of volunteer doctors in the UK to provide direct and individual support for health workers in Zambia.\nFor many communities, it is not practical to expect sick and frail people to walk or cycle for hours to hospital.\nSo families depend on rural health centres, which have health workers but no qualified doctors.\nThe virtual doctors project means that these isolated health centres can be supported by doctors thousands of miles away.\nHealth workers and clinical officers on the ground use an app on a smartphone or tablet computer to take notes on a patient's symptoms and photographs.\nThis information is sent to a volunteer doctor in the UK who helps with a diagnosis and recommends treatment.\nMore stories from the BBC's Global education series looking at education from an international perspective and how to get in touch\nCases are directed towards doctors with a relevant specialism, whether it is skin diseases or HIV and Aids-related problems.\nThe doctor in the UK will have a list of the drugs and equipment kept in the health centre in Zambia and can suggest treatment or further tests based on what is practical and available.\n\"For instance, there's no point calling for an MRI scan,\" says Mr Jones.\nVirtual Doctors is now supporting 19 rural health centres, which typically deal with problems such as malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/Aids and pregnancy-related conditions.\nThere are also two district hospitals taking part in the project.\nMr Jones says that even where there are facilities such as X-ray machines, there can be a shortage of radiologists to look at the evidence.\nThe virtual doctors in the UK have been able to help with chest X-rays of patients in Zambia, he says.\nThese local health centres have catchment areas of tens of thousands of people, and hospitals provide services for hundreds of thousands. And Mr Jones says the virtual doctors are now supporting health services for almost a million people.\nThe charity wants to expand further, with discussions in progress about working with other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including Tanzania and Uganda.\nMobile-phone networks are improving, and that could mean moving to more direct, real-time ways of communicating, such as video conferencing.\nBut Mr Jones says the emphasis must be on a system that is robust, simple, reliable and can be depended upon to work.\nThe app used to connect the virtual doctors was itself made by volunteer coders and developers from the Landmark Information Group in Exeter, working in their spare time.\nFormer Education Secretary Charles Clarke, who is supporting the project, describes it as a \"brilliant initiative that brings together voluntary expertise and desperate need\".\nThe Virtual Doctor system has been backed by the Zambian government.\nMuyeba Chikonde, Zambia's high commissioner in the UK, said he was very pleased at the assistance being provided.\nHe said it was in the spirit of \"ubuntu\" - a word used in southern Africa to suggest a philosophy of sharing and showing \"humanity towards others\".",

And that is worth a lot more money.\n\"I would rather put an honest version of myself forward. And it makes me no money. No-one wants to buy a shirt with me on it.\"\nHe did get in trouble with the Advertising Standards Authority last year, over a promotion with a biscuit brand, that was said not to be clearly labelled as an advert.\n\"I've always tried to be very open and very honest with my audience. I've been caught out by that recently. Apparently I wasn't honest enough,\" he says.\nHe has been open about his problems with mental illness as well, sharing videos with his fans about his depression.\n\"I really don't know what long-term effects my relationship with my audience and with YouTube is going to have on me,\" he says.\n\"I like sharing and I like being very honest and I have found that it feels good but then again maybe it's not.\n\"I've forgotten what the difference is between Thomas Ridgewell and TomSka.\"\n\"You put me in a room with 1,000 fans and I can take photos and sign and be lovely to every single person.\n\"But you put me in a room with 10 people who know the real me and I'm not going to know what to do any more.\"\nThe Creators is available to view on YouTube now.\nFollow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube",

It has been the cornerstone of corporate governance ever since.\nIt recommended an independent board, reasonable pay to attract executives and formal processes to appoint directors.\n\"The Financial Reporting Council which controls the Cadbury code, and is a rather timid body, should get stronger,\" Lord Myners told the BBC's Today programme.\nIt should \"stand up to government and say we need legal change in a number of areas to strengthen governance\".\nThe code has no punitive means of enforcement and follows a so-called comply or explain model. If a company wishes to shun a particular rule, it can give its reasons for doing so.\nThis arrangement aims to stop companies ducking rules as a matter course and rewards openness. But critics say it treats all rules as optional.\n\"It hasn't been binding enough,\" Lord Myners said.\nIn a statement to the BBC, the FRC said: \"The FRC has called on the government for more powers to tackle all directors when companies fail, not just those we regulate (accountants and actuaries), and we want more scrutiny on directors fulfilling their obligations under the Companies Act.\n\"The Corporate Governance Code's 'comply or explain' approach has allowed the FRC to respond confidently and effectively to evolving market circumstances, which prescriptive hard rules often cannot.\"\nIts latest monitoring report on the code shows \"high compliance\" among companies, but when boards don't follow the rules \"too many explanations are of poor quality\".\n\"This suggests that some boards still need to do more than pay lip service to the needs of their shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\"The FRC believes more focused reporting by boards on how they discharge their responsibilities is necessary and has called for more oversight powers from government to help achieve this.\"\nAnother criticism from Lord Myners is the role of shareholders themselves in controlling corporations.\n\"Cadbury did not focus at all on the roles and the duties and obligation of the shareholders and that's where the failing is happening,\" he said.\n\"Nobody owns enough of a company to really be put out enough to really dig in and find out what's wrong.\" He termed this the problem of \"ownerless corporations.\"\nThis view echoed that of Chris Philp, MP for Croydon South, who told the Today programme in September that UK companies should adopt a Swedish-style shareholder committee in an effort to curb excessive pay for bosses.\nThe five biggest shareholders in large publicly-traded companies would sit on the committee, Mr Philp suggested, and this would make decisions on pay and hiring directors.\nHis plan follows a call from Prime Minister Theresa May for tighter controls on corporate excess.",

It showed some civilians insisting that they were not separatists.\n\"Kiev is threatening the citizens of Donetsk Region with psychological attacks from the air. Periodically, military helicopters and planes circle menacingly over the towns of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk,\" Rossiya 1 TV said.\nAnother strand of coverage by Russia's three main TV channels, though, has been to portray the Ukrainian army as weak, disorganised and suffering from poor service conditions and low morale.\nOne report by NTV - owned by state gas giant Gazprom - reported that Ukrainian troops had refused to take orders from their commanders and sided with pro-Russian militiamen, a presenter for NTV reported.\n\"Many servicemen are clearly confused and don't understand how they could point their guns at Ukrainians, the same people as them,\" the channel's correspondent says.\nRussian TV channels have also been showing footage of what they say are local people in Donetsk and Luhansk regions confronting Ukrainian troops. In one instance, locals are seen persuading the crew of a tank not to shoot at civilians. In another, they stop and loot a military truck.\nIn contrast, Ukrainian TV channels have been supportive of what they see as the Kiev authorities' efforts to rein in ''separatists'' and \"militants supported by Russia\".\nUkrainian TV channels say \"small groups\" of violent protesters demanding federalisation or annexation by Russia do not reflect the true sentiment of residents of eastern Ukraine most of whom, they say, want to live in an undivided Ukraine.\nThey have been broadcasting comments from ordinary people in the streets of Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv, most of them saying they want their region to stay in Ukraine.\nThe demands of some Ukrainians for action against the separatists also feature heavily. State-owned UT1 TV provided live coverage of a rally in Kiev's Independence Square, where around 10,000 people demanded that the authorities act more resolutely to protect the eastern regions from \"Russian aggression\".\nUkraine's press, meanwhile, is full of doom-laden speculation about Russia's intentions.\n\"If it fails to push through a federation, Russia will bet on splitting Ukraine - all Russian-speaking regions will become unrecognised territories under the imperial protectorate of the Russian Federation,\" Volodymyr Fesenko writes in Segodnya.\nOthers think Russia's ambitions do not stop there.

Laidlaw's conversion and a subsequent penalty put the Scots 10-3 up before Halfpenny responded with a three-pointer of his own.\nScotland lost fly-half Finn Russell to the sin-bin on the half-hour when he was judged to have taken out opposite number Dan Biggar with a dangerous tackle in the air. Halfpenny brought the score to 10-9 with the resultant penalty.\nWales did not take long to make their one-man advantage count, a sweeping move from inside their own half stretching the Scots' defence to breaking point, and scrum-half Webb diving over in the corner.\nHalfpenny added the extras to put Wales 16-10 up at the break.\nTwo Laidlaw penalties either side of a successful Halfpenny kick kept the Scots within three early in the second-half.\nWales had a Liam Williams try ruled out for an off-the-ball infringement by Alun Wyn Jones, but the referee could not save Scotland 15 minutes from the end when Davies scored Wales' second try.\nThe British and Irish Lion came on to a Biggar pass at pace and, after powering through some soft midfield tackling, the centre coasted under the posts to leave Halfpenny with the simplest of conversions to give Wales a 10-point lead.\nThat looked to have ended the match as a contest, but the Scots refused to buckle, with Mark Bennett and Hogg making searing line breaks.\nThey did force a try in the dying seconds when Welsh ploughed over from close range, but it was too late and once again the home side had to be content with the 'gallant losers' tag.\nScotland: Hogg; Lamont, Bennett, Dunbar, Visser; Russell, Laidlaw; Dickinson, Ford, Cross, R Gray, J Gray, Harley, Cowan, Beattie.\nReplacements: Scott for Dunbar (58), Hidalgo-Clyne for Laidlaw (71), Reid for Dickinson (61), F Brown for Ford (71), Welsh for Cross (50), Hamilton for R Gray (56), Strokosch for Beattie (58).\nNot Used: Tonks.\nSin Bin: Russell (32).\nWales: Halfpenny; Cuthbert, J Davies, Roberts, L Williams; Biggar, Webb; Jenkins, Hibbard, Jarvis, Ball, A Jones, Lydiate, Warburton, Faletau.\nReplacements: M.

    "document": "Just as David Letterman had his painfully awkward \"Uma, Oprah\" routine and Seth Macfarlane his catastrophically misjudged song We Saw Your Boobs, Harris will be recalled mostly as the guy who presented in his pants.\nIt was certainly an arresting image, the How I Met Your Mother star clad only in socks, shoes and what are referred to in America as \"tighty whiteys.\" It was a reference to a scene from Birdman, and - like any time Johnny Depp sings - you had to admire the courage, if not the execution.\nAnd at least it was memorable, unlike almost anything Harris actually said.\nBafflingly, given the amount of potential material to work with - the Sony hack; the Interview row; the #OscarsSoWhite Twitter campaign - the script saw Harris referring to Reese Witherspoon as someone he could eat \"with a spoon.\"\nThe actor was one of a team of 12 Oscar writers. Just think - one of them worked on that humdinger. The other 11 approved it.\nEven more puzzling, things had started brilliantly. The first line was by far the best - \"tonight we honour Hollywood's best and whitest - sorry, brightest\" - a reference to the #OscarsSoWhite debate that followed the nominations.\nThen there was the opening song, about the wonder of \"moving pictures\", featuring Harris, Anna Kendrick and Jack Black - and dancing Stormtroopers.\nHarris, a Tony Award-winner on Broadway, pulled it off like Steve Martin or Billy Crystal at their best, putting himself into classic movie scenes while pulling off clever rhymes like \"Argo / And Fargo / Or when Marty made his car go\".\nHaving nailed it, he turned to the camera and smiled. \"That whole thing? Completely improvised.\"\nIt was pretty much the last big laugh he achieved. From there on, flat setups began crashing into flubbed punchlines with the alacrity of a drunk sailor inviting the entire pub to have a go if they think they're hard enough.\nThere was a predictable joke about Harvey Weinstein (there always is); a bit where he started to talk to the seat fillers and then seemed to immediately lose heart; a routine about his Oscar predictions so laboured it was on the verge of setting up its own union.\nBy halfway through there was terror in Harris' eyes whenever the camera came to him. A part where he asked David Oyelowo to read an insult about the remake of Annie - which had recast the lead with a black actress - was fist-gnawingly uncomfortable.\nIt's worth noting, however, that it was this undercurrent of racial politics that gave the night its most memorable moments.\nOyelowo was in tears as he listened to the performance of Glory by John Legend and Common from Selma. It was an intense, powerful performance which had the entire audience on their feet as it finished.\nWhen Glory shortly afterwards gained Legend and Common (under their real names of John Stephens and Lonnie Lynn) the best song trophy, they electrified with a passionate joint speech.\n\"Nina Simone said it was an artist's duty to reflect the times we live. Selma may be 50 years ago, but it is now, because the struggle for justice is right now,\" they insisted, and the music that normally strikes up to urge the winners off the stage stayed silent.\nIndeed it was a night for politics. Best Actress Patricia Arquette called for equality for women; Best Adapted Screenplay winner Graham Moore urged young people confused about their sexuality to \"stay weird\"; Best Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu spoke about the Mexicans \"who came before and built this incredible immigrant nation\".\nMeanwhile, at the end - in every sense - Harris fluffed a gag about mispronouncing Chiwetel Ejiofor's name.\nIn the context of what had preceded it, it struck a particularly flat note. The Oscars aren't going to stop being seen as white and elitist if every year the writers insist on mining this seam of \"exotic names are weird and hard to say.\"\nThat is hardly Harris' fault. Nevertheless, it really did highlight the contrast of the night: That between black politics and white pants.",

    "document": "The world changed on 6 August 1945. Arguably, the appalling effects of that first atomic strike - and the subsequent attack on Nagasaki - have played a large part in the determination to prevent the use of far more devastating weapons developed since.\nBack then, the US was the only nation with \"the bomb\".\nThe story since has been of the steady spread, the proliferation, of nuclear weapons: first to Russia, Britain, France and China - then to Israel (although never officially acknowledged), India, Pakistan, North Korea.\nThe big powers seemed either unable or unwilling to prevent that spread except perhaps now - in the case of Iran.\nAll sorts of conflicting signals are coming out of the international talks in Vienna meant to end all the hostility between the major world powers and Iran over its much disputed nuclear programme. There's talk of both breakdown and possible breakthrough.\nSo why is it judged so important to stop Iran?\nI asked Sir John Sawers, chief British negotiator with Iran from 2003 to 2007, and after that the UK's representative on the UN Security Council when sanctions against Iran were being decided.\nHe said: \"If Iran acquired a nuclear weapon, then it would change the dynamic across the Middle East.\n\"It would make them invulnerable to any response to their unacceptable behaviour in the region.\"\nSir John told me: \"If there is an agreement then, first of all, it gives everyone much greater assurance that Iran is not going to make a break for nuclear weapons.\n\"It opens the possibility of Iran and its Arab neighbours coming together and developing a more normal relationship.\n\"At the moment, the Middle East is riven by disputes - many of them along Sunni-Shia lines - and if we can create a possibility whereby Saudis and Iranians can talk to one another and it is not driven by continuous hostility, then there is a possibility of creating a different sort of Middle East.\"\nIt's not just August 1945 which hangs heavy over the negotiations with Iran.\nThe events of February 1979 in Iran itself, and everything which has followed, help explain the years of suspicion and outright hostility between Tehran and Washington which a nuclear deal could do so much to ease.\nAyatollah Khomeini's triumphant return to Tehran - on 1 February 1979 - from exile in Paris to take power as supreme leader of an Islamic Republic symbolises the moment when the US and its allies lost control of Iran with the fall of the shah.\nThe years of blatant Western interference were over.\nRuhollah Khomeini was born in Kohmeyn in central Iran. He became a religious scholar and in the early 1920s rose to become an 'ayatollah', a term for a leading Shia scholar.\nArrested in 1962 by the shah's security service for his outspoken opposition to the pro-Western regime of the Shah. His arrest elevated him to the status of national hero.\nExiled in 1964, living in Turkey, Iraq and then France, from where he urged his supporters to overthrow the shah.\nIn January 1979, the shah's government collapsed and he and his family fled into exile. On 1 February, Khomeini returned to Iran in triumph.\nThere was a national referendum and Khomeini won a landslide victory. He declared an Islamic republic and was appointed Iran's political and religious leader for life.\nIslamic law was introduced across the country.\nThe new religious leadership inherited a nuclear research programme, but consistently denies expanding it with the aim of making \"the bomb\".\nThe big powers have never accepted that, pointing instead to all the Iranian effort to produce highly-enriched uranium in the quantities you could only need to build a bomb, as well as the secrecy and alleged concealment of so much activity which is specifically outlawed by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to which Iran is a signatory.\nYears of pressure applied by sanctions and negotiations to find a way forward have now reached a point where agreement could - just could - be possible.\nI spoke to Ariane Tabatabai, of Georgetown University, who, like me, has been in Vienna to follow what is supposed to be the endgame in these talks.\nShe told me: \"Ultimately, the negotiations are about making sure that Iran's nuclear programme remains peaceful and to do that it needs to provide a set of assurances and that would mean Iran scaling back some of its nuclear activities.\n\"It will also provide more transparency to the International Atomic Energy Agency to make sure that everything is essentially under constant monitoring, with enhanced access given to its facilities so the international community can verify that Iran is holding its end of the bargain.\"\nWhich brings us neatly to the unanswerable question: Is the Iranian leadership ready to make a bargain?\nIt could be, partly to pacify those Iranians fed up with sanctions which help cripple their economy and symbolise isolation from a fast-developing world they yearn to be part of.\nProfessor Ali Ansari, historian of Iran at St Andrews University, pointed me to another of the country's ambitions, which is to recover some of the global respect which Iran believes it is due.\n\"What the Iranians are after is a degree of respect as a country that considers itself a great power - certainly in the region - that has not had a good time in the last century or so.\n\"The real pride and achievement is that they have developed what they've considered to be an indigenous nuclear industry.\n\"One of the arguments many people have made is that an Islamic government wouldn't be scientifically advanced.\n\"Well for the Iranians, you know, this is, sort of proof that it actually can be, if they put their mind to it.\"\nBut Prof Ansari is far from certain that a deal can be done, and - even if it is - that it will hold.\nAnd Sir John, from all his years negotiating with Iran, is blunt: \"Whenever you buy a carpet in Iran, you have to buy it two, three times over.\n\"You sometimes feel that is the same in the nuclear negotiations as well. There is an Iranian saying that the real negotiation only begins once the agreement is signed.\n\"They will always come back for more. Even if we get an agreement - it doesn't mean it is 'peace in our time'.\"\nSo suspicion on both sides remains strong.\nWhatever happens in the next few days, building and then maintaining trust between Iran and the key world powers, particularly the US, is still the toughest of all the challenges.",

    "document": "The regulator has agreed to increase the amount of weight graphite bricks at the core of the reactor at Dungeness B in Kent will be allowed to lose.\nThe bricks, which degrade over time due to radiation, are vital for safety.\nThe Office for Nuclear Regulation said it was a \"robust\" body but one expert accused it of \"moving the goalposts\".\nThe nuclear reactor at Dungeness B would have breached the safety margin within months which could have forced the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) to prosecute or even shut it down.\nThe safety margins cover thousands of graphite bricks at the core of Britain's 14 elderly Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors (AGRs).\nBut the bricks, each about a metre in height, are both cracking and starting to lose weight due to decades of radiation, and that could affect safety.\nThe current graphite weight loss limit for Dungeness is set at 6.2% but the regulator says when it reached 5.7% its operator, French power giant EDF, applied to raise it to 8%.\nMark Foy, deputy chief inspector at the Office for Nuclear Regulation, said \"We will be in a position to agree that 8% limit within the next few weeks. Ageing is a nuclear safety issue\".\nAs part of that ageing process the licensee was required to monitor and inspect the reactors regularly.\nSteve Thomas, professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich, said: \"It doesn't feel good when we come up against limits and the first thing they [the ONR] do is to move the goalposts.\"\nMr Foy stressed that the ONR was a \"robust regulator\" and due process had been followed.\n\"If we feel the evidence they [EDF] have supplied is robust and sufficient to underpin the 8% case then we will agree it,\" he said.\nThe graphite bricks are integral to UK nuclear power stations and they act to moderate the nuclear reaction; it will not function without them.\nThe bricks cannot be replaced which means they are being carefully monitored as the reactors age. They become damaged through years of intense bombardment by radiation and effects of the coolant CO2 on the material.\nA distortion to the graphite core could prevent the control rods being inserted, which shut down the reactor in an emergency.\nEDF said \"safety of the public and our employees is our overriding priority\" and the company took a \"cautious approach\" working closely with the regulator and they operated with \"very conservative safety margins\" and safety requirements were \"stringent\".\nBut in shifting the graphite limit Dungeness can still run only until the start of 2020 but that is still three years fewer than EDF would like and it may have to request a second increase in the safety limit.\nProf Paul Mummery, from Manchester University, agreed that the original limits were \"conservative.\"\nBut he said the twin problems of graphite cracking and weight loss meant it may be \"uneconomic\" for EDF to keep all the 14 AGR reactors running in the long term because the regulator may insist on more inspections to demonstrate safety.\n\"They [EDF] are making good progress but I would not be able to say with absolute confidence that they will reach 2023,\" he said.\nIt was an \"engineering judgement\", he said, but \"no one could be sure\".\n\"There was more weight loss than expected in Dungeness B and that has led to some uncertainty about the continued operation.\"\nThe AGR reactors contribute about 15% of Britain's electricity, according to Prof Thomas.\nHe said EDF wanted the old AGR reactors to last until the planned next generation of nuclear power stations came on line after 2023 but said it was reaching a \"crunch point\".\nThe old reactors might not last as long as EDF would like and there were still real doubts about the plans to build the new reactor at Hinkley C in Somerset.",

How did this happen yet nobody knew?\n\"No matter how dark and depressing it gets, change has to happen now.\"\nCoe, elected IAAF president in August, described the Wada report as \"alarming\" and has said he will seek urgent approval from members to consider sanctions against the Russian federation.\nThe report found evidence of multiple rules breaches by IAAF officials and found the governing body to be \"inexplicably lax in following up suspicious blood (and other) profiles\".\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIt has also been criticised for its handling of the allegations, with Coe himself describing claims about suspicious blood profiles involving some athletes as \"a declaration of war on my sport\" in August.\nOn Monday, Coe said that \"if there are failings in our governance or our anti-doping programme I will fix them\".\nBut Warner says Coe needs to restructure the IAAF in order for it to effectively tackle the problem.\n\"This cannot be a one-man crusade,\" Warner told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"He needs to ensure there is a bench around him at the IAAF who dramatically improve the operation.\n\"We all know, and he has already said, he needs to go out and hire a good chief executive.\n\"It needs more than that.

The fifth, an Army reservist, was based in London.\nThe Ministry of Defence said the crash near Kandahar air base appeared to have been a \"tragic accident\".\nIt represents the third single biggest loss of life of British troops in Afghanistan since the conflict began.\nThe families of all five servicemen have been told.\nThree of the soldiers on board the helicopter were from the Army Air Corps, based at RAF Odiham in Hampshire, the MoD said late on Saturday.\nA fourth member of the crew was serving with the Royal Air Force and was also based at Odiham, while the fifth man was an Army reservist from 3 Military Intelligence Battalion, in London.\nMaj Gen Richard Felton, Commander Joint Helicopter Command, said: \"It is with great sadness that we must confirm that five UK service personnel have been killed in this incident which, at this early stage, would appear to have been a tragic accident.\n\"Events like this, whilst mercifully rare, remind us of the risks our personnel face in their work in Afghanistan as we approach the conclusion of the combat mission later this year.\n\"Our thoughts are with the families and loved ones of those who have lost their lives.\"\nPrime Minister David Cameron said his \"heart goes out to the families and friends of those killed in this terrible tragedy\".\nLabour leader Ed Miliband said it was \"tragic and poignant reminder of the sacrifices made by our armed forces in serving our country with bravery and distinction\".\nIt is the first fatal accident involving a UK military helicopter in Afghanistan since the conflict began in 2001.\nBBC defence correspondent Caroline Wyatt said sources had suggested the cause of the crash may have been \"technical problems\" on board the helicopter, despite claims by the Taliban that its fighters had shot it down.\nShe said the location of the crash - close to the border with Pakistan - has also led to speculation that the helicopter could have been taking part in a special forces mission.\nIt is understood the helicopter was a Westland Lynx Mk 9.\nA Ministry of Defence spokesman said: \"We can confirm that a UK helicopter crashed in southern Afghanistan today.\n\"The incident is under investigation and it would be inappropriate to comment further until families have been notified.\"\nThe crash is understood to have happened around 30 miles from the Pakistan border, near Kandahar air base in the Takhta Pul district.\nThe deaths bring the number of British forces killed in the conflict in Afghanistan to 453.\nThe fatal crash comes after a Nimrod surveillance aircraft exploded in mid-air while supporting Nato ground operations near Kandahar, killing all 14 servicemen on board, in September 2006.\nThis incident remains the biggest single loss of UK life at one time in Afghanistan.\nIn 2012, six British soldiers were killed when a Warrior armoured fighting vehicle in Kandahar province was hit by an explosion.\nThe International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) coalition of international forces said it was still in the process of reviewing the circumstances of Saturday's helicopter crash.\n\"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends affected by this tragic event,\" it said in a statement.\nDefence analyst Paul Beaver said all the indications are that the crash involved a Lynx helicopter, which he said has an \"exceptional record\".\nHe said the light utility helicopter is likely to have been operating in \"fairly mountainous areas\", or in \"challenging\" terrain.\n\"The key now will be looking at the weather,\" Mr Beaver told the BBC.\n\"If enemy action is not suspected, which is what the MoD is saying, then you have to look at whether this might well be weather-related.\"\nThe crash brings the total number of international troops killed in Afghanistan in April to seven.\nIt comes after the last major helicopter crash took place in December last year, when seven Americans and four Afghans died.\nIn August 2011, the Taliban shot down an American Chinook near Kabul, killing 30 Americans and eight Afghans in the deadliest single incident for US troops since the war began.\nConcerned family members can contact the MoD's Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre on 08457 800 900.",

He left a lesser figure.\nThe referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans.\nSurely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex?\nNo.\nInstead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets.\n\"When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',\" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference.\n\"And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'\"\nWhen he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion.\nIn Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example.\nBurns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights.\nBuchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport.\n\"There are some big fights out there for me,\" said Burns.\n\"I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford again if it came down to it.\n\"That's nearly two years I have been with Tony and things have just started clicking.\n\"I had a bit of a bad run in the last year with stuff. Who'd have thought I'd be sitting here world champion again?\"\nHearn said suitors could \"make all the offers they want, we'll listen\".\n\"If they want to come with a sack-load of money for Ricky to defend his title against Broner in Vegas, I'm sure there are a few Scots who would like a trip there as well.\"\nAt that point Burns quipped: \"I'd be one of them.\"\nThe lovely thing is, you suspect Burns was speaking in the guise of a fan rather than that of a three-weight world champion who could enjoy a profitable title defence.",

If he went to Celtic, I think his performance level would go up a notch.

You've got to take that opportunity because getting the opportunity to sign, whether it's a Rangers or Celtic - one of the bigger clubs - you don't knock it back.\"\nRangers have had three bids for the 23-year-old rejected, with the Edinburgh side adamant they will not do business with a Championship rival. Allan submitted a transfer request following the second of those offers from Ibrox.\nFerguson spent seven years at Rangers between 1983 and 1990 and admitted he could not have made the switch to city rivals Celtic, but recalled the time when one former Celtic player famously joined the Ibrox club.\n\"In the era I played in, personally, no,\" he told BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound programme.\n\"I think it would take a certain type of character. I was at Rangers when Mo Johnston signed. I thought he was crazy. I think Mo was one of the guys that could handle that situation.\n\"It was amazing because I remember the times when season tickets and scarves were thrown onto the pitch. The Rangers fans would not turn up and watch Rangers Football Club, but when Mo Johnston started banging in the goals, those empty seats started to fill up.\n\"It's about what you do on the park at the end of the day.\"\nSomeone who has witnessed first-hand what Allan can produce on the pitch is former Hibs captain Liam Craig, who played with the ex-West Brom man at Easter Road during the 2014-15 season.\nCraig believes Allan has the \"character\" to go onto great things at Parkhead if the transfer materialises.\n\"Could he go and play in Celtic's team? I think he could,\" he told BBC Radio Scotland\n\"I think Hibs are right not to do business with Rangers. They know how important Scott is to them and how close it's going to be between them and Rangers this season.\n\"Probably what Hibs don't want is, come January, when there's six months left on his contract, he goes and signs a pre-contract with Rangers.

    "document": "The skeleton of \"Thankerton Man\" was found in a stone cist - a type of burial chamber - at Boatbridge Quarry, Thankerton, South Lanarkshire, in 1970.\nIt was radiocarbon-dated to between 2460BC and 2140BC and thought to have been that of a man aged 18 to 25.\nThe reconstructed image will go on show at the Biggar and Upper Clydesdale Museum, which opens on Tuesday.\nThe reconstruction was produced by specialists from Dundee University's Centre for Anatomy and Human Identification (CAHID) who worked from detailed analysis of the skull.\nCaroline Erolin, lecturer in forensic and medical art at CAHID, said: \"Given its age, the skeleton of Thankerton Man was in excellent condition, which allowed us to get a strong impression of how he may have looked.\n\"Once we built the basic shape of his face we then looked at historical data to get a better idea of how a man would have looked at that time. For instance, we know they had the ability to shave.\"\nThe estimated height of the man was around 1.8 metres (5ft 11ins), which is regarded as tall in Copper Age terms.\nThe cist contained a finely-decorated beaker which had held food or drink for the deceased's journey into the afterlife.\nThe pot and skeleton are curated by National Museums Scotland.\nDr Alison Sheridan, principal curator of early prehistory at National Museums Scotland, who provided archaeological advice, praised the reconstruction.\nShe said: \"This is a magnificent piece of work that really brings the past to light. It has spurred us on to arrange the DNA analysis of this man's remains.\"",

    "document": "Thousands of children have been examined every 10 years since 1973.\nA third of children in Wales were said to have good oral health overall, which compares to 39% in England.\nDecay was found in 52% of 12 year olds and 63% of 15 year olds, a slight improvement on the 2003 survey.\nBut around 70% of them reported problems with their teeth.\nDecay was found in 41% of five-year-old children in their primary teeth and in 55% of eight-year-old pupils, according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre report.\nSevere dental problems were worse among children from poorer backgrounds.\nAround a half (47%) of five year olds could be said to have good oral health.\nBut that declined with age, to around a quarter of 15 year old children.\nOther findings:\nThe last results in 2003 showed that oral health had improved greatly since the 1970s and 1980s.\nThis time, 12 and 15-year-olds were also asked to fill in a questionnaire on how they looked after their teeth.\nIn 2009 the Welsh government launched a national scheme to encourage better dental health amongst young children. Since then it has invested over \u00c2\u00a312m in the programme.\nIt also suggested the programme had led to a recent  6% drop in the proportion of five-year-olds experiencing dental decay.\nExperts point out there could be several reason the health of children's teeth in Wales was still lagging behind those from other UK nations including socio-economic conditions.\nThat survey 10 years ago also showed a big drop in 15-year-olds with obvious decay from 94% in 1983 to 58%.\nScottish children are not included in the 2013 survey but Wales has better results than Northern Ireland, where 31% were judged to be in good oral health.\nThe Welsh Government said its own most recent monitoring survey showed a 6% drop in the proportion of five-year-olds with dental decay.\n\"However, there is more to do to improve the dental health of children in Wales especially since the vast majority of tooth decay is avoidable,\" said a spokesperson.\n\"Parents can help their children by reducing sugar intake and encouraging them to brush their teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste. \"\nIt has also published its own survey of dental health to identify how much decay among five-years-olds is already present at the age of three.",

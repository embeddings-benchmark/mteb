The high speed of such craft enabled them to avoid interception by the Coast Guard. More recently the term \"cigarette boat\" has replaced the term \"rum-runner\". The present era of cigarette boats, dating from the 1960s, owes much of their design to boats designed for offshore powerboat racing, particularly by designer and builder Donald Aronow. During this period, these boats were used by drug smugglers to transfer drugs across the Caribbean to the United States."

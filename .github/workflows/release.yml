# This workflow will
# - Find the latest version tag based on the commit history
#   - Create a git tag for the new version
#   - Update the version number in pyproject.toml based on the commit history
# - Upload the package to PyPI
# - Create a release on GitHub

# This workflow required the following secrets to be set:
# - a GitHub personal access token with the `repo` scope called `RELEASE`
# - and that you setup trusted publishing using PyPI as described here: https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2023-04-20-introducing-trusted-publishers/

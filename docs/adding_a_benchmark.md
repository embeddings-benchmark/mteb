## Adding a benchmark

The MTEB Leaderboard is available [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) and we love new benchmarks. To add a new benchmark:

1. Add your benchmark to [benchmark.py](../mteb/benchmarks/benchmarks.py):
2. Open a PR at https://github.com/embedding-benchmark/results with results of models on your benchmark.
3. When PRs will be merged, your benchmark will be added to the leaderboard automatically.

## Adding a model to the Leaderboard

The MTEB Leaderboard is available [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard). To submit to it:

1. Add the [model meta](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb/blob/main/docs/adding_a_model.md#adding-a-model-implementation) to `mteb`
2. [Evaluate](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb/blob/main/docs/usage/usage.md#evaluating-a-model) the desired model using `mteb` on the [desired benchmarks](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb/blob/main/docs/usage/usage.md#selecting-a-benchmark)
3. Push the results to the [results repository](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/results) via a PR. Once merged they will appear on the leaderboard after a day.


## Adding a model implementation

Adding a model implementation to `mteb` is quite straightforward.
Typically it only requires that you fill in metadata about the model and add it to the [model directory](../mteb/models/):

```python
from mteb.model_meta import ModelMeta

my_model = ModelMeta(
    name="model_name",
    languages=["eng-Latn"], # follows ISO 639-3 and BCP-47
    open_weights=True,
    revision="5617a9f61b028005a4858fdac845db406aefb181",
    release_date="2025-01-01",
    n_parameters=568_000_000,
    memory_usage_mb=2167,
    embed_dim=4096,
    license="mit",
    max_tokens=8194,
    reference="https://huggingface.co/user-or-org/model-name",
    similarity_fn_name="cosine",
    framework=["Sentence Transformers", "PyTorch"],
    use_instructions=False,
    public_training_code="https://github.com/user-or-org/my-training-code",
    public_training_data="https://huggingface.co/datasets/user-or-org/full-dataset",
    training_datasets={"MSMARCO": ["train"]}, # if you trained on the MSMARCO training set
)
```

This works for all [Sentence Transformers](https://sbert.net) compatible models. Once filled out, you can submit your model to `mteb` by
submitting a PR.


### Calculating the Memory Usage

To calculate `memory_usage_mb`, run:

```py
model_meta = mteb.get_model_meta("model_name")
model_meta.calculate_memory_usage_mb()
```

### Adding instruction models

Some models, such as the [E5 models](https://huggingface.co/intfloat/multilingual-e5-large-instruct), use instructions or prompts.
You can directly add the prompts when saving and uploading your model to the Hub. Refer to this [configuration file as an example](https://huggingface.co/Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-m-v1.5/blob/3b5a16eaf17e47bd997da998988dce5877a57092/config_sentence_transformers.json). 

However, you can also add these directly to the model configuration:

```python
model = ModelMeta(
    loader=partial(
        sentence_transformers_loader,
        model_name="intfloat/multilingual-e5-small",
        revision="fd1525a9fd15316a2d503bf26ab031a61d056e98",
        model_prompts={
           "query": "query: ",
           "passage": "passage: ",
        },
    ),
)
```

### Using a custom Implementation

If you need to use a custom implementation, you can specify the `loader` parameter in the `ModelMeta` class. For example:
```python
from mteb.models.wrapper import Wrapper
from mteb.encoder_interface import PromptType
import numpy as np

class CustomWrapper(Wrapper):
    def __init__(self, model_name, model_revision):
        super().__init__(model_name, model_revision)
        # your custom implementation here

    def encode(
        self,
        sentences: list[str],
        *,
        task_name: str,
        prompt_type: PromptType | None = None,
        **kwargs
    ) -> np.ndarray:
        # your custom implementation here
        return np.zeros((len(sentences), self.embed_dim))
```

Then you can specify the `loader` parameter in the `ModelMeta` class:

```python
your_model = ModelMeta(
    loader=partial(
        CustomWrapper,
        model_name="model_name",
        model_revision="5617a9f61b028005a4858fdac845db406aefb181"
    ),
    ...
)
```


### Adding model dependencies
If your are adding a model that requires additional dependencies, you can add them to the `pyproject.toml` file, under optional dependencies:

```toml
voyageai = ["voyageai>=1.0.0,<2.0.0"]
```

This ensure that the implementation does not break if a package is updated.

As it is an optional dependency, you can't use top-level dependencies, but will instead have to use import inside the wrapper scope:

In the [voyage_models.py](../mteb/models/voyage_models.py) file, we have added the following code:
```python
from mteb.requires_package import requires_package

class VoyageWrapper(Wrapper):
    def __init__(...) -> None:
        requires_package(self, "voyageai", model_name, "pip install 'mteb[voyageai]'")
        import voyageai
        ...
```
Here you will also see that we use  to ensure friendly error messages when package installations are required.
If you want to give a suggestion instead of a warning, you can use [`suggest_package`](../mteb/requires_packages.py).

### Submitting your model as a PR

When submitting you models as a PR, please copy and paste the following checklist into pull request message:

- [ ] I have filled out the ModelMeta object to the extent possible
- [ ] I have ensured that my model can be loaded using
  - [ ] `mteb.get_model(model_name, revision)` and
  - [ ] `mteb.get_model_meta(model_name, revision)`
- [ ] I have tested the implementation works on a representative set of tasks.
- [ ] The model is public, i.e. is available either as an API or the wieght are publicly avaiable to download

# MTEB Documentation

!!! info
    We recently released `mteb` version 2.0.0, to see what is new check of [what is new](./whats_new.md#new-in-v20) and see [how to upgrade](./whats_new.md#upgrading-from-v1) your existing code.

Welcome documentation of MTEB. `mteb` a package for benchmark and evaluating the quality of embeddings.

MTEB is the go-to documentation for evaluating embeddings models across a variety of tasks, modalities and domains. MTEB covers more than a 1000 different tasks from covering a diverse set of tasks from historic Swedish patent classification to documentation retrieval for Python. These tasks spread across more than 1000 languages and cover both image and text tasks.

This package was initially introduced as a package for evaluating text embeddings predominantly for English[@mteb_2023], but have since been extended for broad languages coverage[@mmteb_2025] and to support multiple modalities[@mieb_2025].


## Installation 

Installation is as simple as:

=== "pip"
    ```bash
    pip install mteb
    ```

=== "uv"
    ```bash
    uv add mteb
    ```

## Quickstart


=== "Using Script"

    To evaluating a model simply select a model, select tasks and evaluate:

    ```python
    import mteb
    from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

    # Select model
    model_name = "average_word_embeddings_komninos"
    model = mteb.get_model(model_name) # if the model is not implemented in MTEB it will be eq. to SentenceTransformer(model_name)

    # Select tasks
    tasks = mteb.get_tasks(tasks=["Banking77Classification"])

    # evaluate
    results = mteb.evaluate(model, tasks=tasks)
    ```

    To see more check out the [usage documentation](./usage/usage.md)

=== "Using the CLI"

    To run a model from the cli simply specify the `--model/-m` and the `--tasks/-t`
    ```bash
    mteb run \ 
        -m sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 \
        -t Banking77Classification \
        --output-folder results
    ```

    To read more about what you can do with the command line interface check out its [documentation](./cli.md)

## Citing


MTEB was introduced in the paper "MTEB: Massive Text Embedding Benchmark"[@mteb_2023], and heavily expanded in "MMTEB: Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark"[@mmteb_2025]. When using `mteb`, we recommend that you cite both articles.

If you use any of the specific benchmarks, we also recommend that you cite the paper, which you can obtain using:

```python
benchmark = mteb.get_benchmark("MTEB(eng, v2)")
benchmark.citation # get citation for a specific benchmark

# you can also create a table of the task for the appendix using:
benchmark.tasks.to_latex()
```

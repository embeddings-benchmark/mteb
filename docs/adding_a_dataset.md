# Adding a Dataset

To add a new dataset to MTEB, you need to do three things:

1) Implement a task with the desired dataset, by subclassing an abstract task
2) Add metadata to the task
3) Submit the edits to the [MTEB](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb) repository

If you have any questions regarding this process feel free to open a discussion [thread](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb/discussions).

> Note: When we mention adding a dataset we refer to a subclass of one of the abstasks.

## 1) Creating a new subclass

### A Simple Example

To add a new task, you need to implement a new class that inherits from the `AbsTask` associated with the task type (e.g. `AbsTaskReranking` for reranking tasks). You can find the supported task types in [here](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb-draft/tree/main/mteb/abstasks).

```python
from mteb import MTEB
from mteb.abstasks.AbsTaskReranking import AbsTaskReranking
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from mteb.abstasks.TaskMetadata import TaskMetadata

class SciDocsReranking(AbsTaskReranking):
    metadata = TaskMetadata(
        name="SciDocsRR",
        description="Ranking of related scientific papers based on their title.",
        reference="https://allenai.org/data/scidocs",
        type="Reranking",
        category="s2s",
        eval_splits=["test"],
        eval_langs=["eng-Latn"],
        main_score="map",
        dataset={
            "path": "mteb/scidocs-reranking",
            "revision": "d3c5e1fc0b855ab6097bf1cda04dd73947d7caab",
        }
        date=("2000-01-01", "2020-12-31"), # best guess
        form="written",

        text_creation="found",

        avg_character_length={"test": 69.0},

    abstract = "Representation learning is a critical ingredient for natural language processing systems. Recent Transformer language models like BERT learn powerful textual representations, but these models are targeted towards token- and sentence-level training objectives and do not leverage information on inter-document relatedness, which limits their document-level representation power. For applications on scientific documents, such as classification and recommendation, accurate embeddings of documents are a necessity. We propose SPECTER, a new method to generate document-level embedding of scientific papers based on pretraining a Transformer language model on a powerful signal of document-level relatedness: the citation graph. Unlike existing pretrained language models, Specter can be easily applied to downstream applications without task-specific fine-tuning. Additionally, to encourage further research on document-level models, we introduce SciDocs, a new evaluation benchmark consisting of seven document-level tasks ranging from citation prediction, to document classification and recommendation. We show that Specter outperforms a variety of competitive baselines on the benchmark.",

)

# testing the task with a model:
model = SentenceTransformer("average_word_embeddings_komninos")
evaluation = MTEB(tasks=[MindSmallReranking()])
evaluation.run(model)
```

> **Note:** for multilingual tasks, make sure your class also inherits from the `MultilingualTask` class like in [this](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb-draft/blob/main/mteb/tasks/Classification/MTOPIntentClassification.py) example.
> For cross-lingual tasks, make sure your class also inherits from the `CrosslingualTask` class like in [this](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb/blob/main/mteb/tasks/BitextMining/TatoebaBitextMining.py).



### A Detailed Example
Often the dataset from HuggingFace is not in the format expected by MTEB. To resolve this you can either change the format on Hugging Face or add a `dataset_transform` method to your dataset to transform it into the right format on the fly. Here is an example along with some design considerations:

```python
class VGClustering(AbsTaskClustering):
    metadata = TaskMetadata(
        name="VGClustering",
        description="Articles and their classes (e.g. sports) from VG news articles extracted from Norsk Aviskorpus.",
        reference="https://huggingface.co/datasets/navjordj/VG_summarization",
        type="Clustering",
        category="p2p",
        eval_splits=["test"],
        eval_langs=["nob-Latn"],
        main_score="v_measure",
        dataset={
            "path": "navjordj/VG_summarization",
            "revision": "d4c5a8ba10ae71224752c727094ac4c46947fa29",
        },
        date=("2012-01-01", "2020-01-01"),
        form="written",
        domains=["Academic", "Non-fiction"],
        task_subtypes=["Scientific Reranking"],
        license="cc-by-nc",
        socioeconomic_status="high",
        annotations_creators="derived",
        dialect=None,
        text_creation="found",
        bibtex_citation= ... # removed for brevity
)

    def dataset_transform(self):
        splits = self.description["eval_splits"]

        documents: list = []
        labels: list = []
        label_col = "classes"

        ds = {}
        for split in splits:
            ds_split = self.dataset[split]

            _label = self.normalize_labels(ds_split[label_col])
            documents.extend(ds_split["title"])
            labels.extend(_label)

            documents.extend(ds_split["ingress"])
            labels.extend(_label)

            documents.extend(ds_split["article"])
            labels.extend(_label)

            assert len(documents) == len(labels)

            rng = random.Random(1111)  # local only seed
            pairs = list(zip(documents, labels))
            rng.shuffle(pairs)
            documents, labels = [list(collection) for collection in zip(*pairs)]

            # To get a more robust estimate we create batches of size 512, this decision can vary depending on dataset
            documents_batched = list(batched(documents, 512))
            labels_batched = list(batched(labels, 512))

            # reduce the size of the dataset as we see that we obtain a consistent scores (if we change the seed) even
            # with only 512x4 samples.
            documents_batched = documents_batched[:4]
            labels_batched = labels_batched[:4]


            ds[split] = datasets.Dataset.from_dict(
                {
                    "sentences": documents_batched,
                    "labels": labels_batched,
                }
            )

        self.dataset = datasets.DatasetDict(ds)
```

## 2) Creating the metadata object
Along with the task MTEB requires metadata regarding the task. If the metadata isn't available please provide your best guess or leave the field as `None`.

To get an overview of the fields in the metadata object, you can look at the [TaskMetadata](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb/blob/main/mteb/abstasks/TaskMetadata.py) class.


Note that these fields can be left blank if the information is not available and can be extended if necessary. We do not include any machine-translated (without verification) datasets in the benchmark.

## Submit a PR

Once you are finished create a PR to the [MTEB](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb) repository. If you haven't created a PR before please refer to the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/)

The PR will be reviewed by one of the organizers or contributors who might ask you to change things. Once the PR is approved the dataset will be added into the main repository.


Before you commit here is a checklist you should consider completing before submitting:

- [ ] I have tested that the dataset runs with the `mteb` package.

An easy way to test it is using:
```python
from mteb import MTEB
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Define the sentence-transformers model name
model_name = "sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2"

model = SentenceTransformer(model_name)
evaluation = MTEB(tasks=[YourNewTask()])
```

- [ ] I have run the following models on the task (adding the results to the pr). These can be run using the `mteb -m {model_name} -t {task_name}` command.
  - [ ] `sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2`
  - [ ] `intfloat/multilingual-e5-small`
- [ ] I have checked that the performance is neither trivial (both models gain close to perfect scores) nor random (both models gain close to random scores).
- [ ] I have considered the size of the dataset and reduced it if it is too big (2048 examples is typically large enough for most tasks)
- [ ] Run tests locally to make sure nothing is broken using `make test`.
- [ ] Run the formatter to format the code using `make lint`.

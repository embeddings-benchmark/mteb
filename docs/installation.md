# Installation

You can install `mteb` using [pip](missing) simply by running:

```bash
pip install mteb
```

## Model specific installations
If you want to run certain models implemented within mteb you will often need some additional dependencies. These can be installed using:

```
pip install mteb[openai]
```

If a specific mdel requires a dependency it will raise an error with the recommended installation. To get an overview of the implemented models see [here](missing).

<!-- TODO: ^this is not entirely true, som recommend directly installing the package - we should probably fix this  -->

# New in v2.0 ðŸŽ‰
This section goes through new features added in v2. Below we give an overview of changes following by detailed examples.

**Overview of changes:**

- [Easier evaluation using `mteb.evaluate`](#easier-evaluation)
- [Easier caching and results loading using the `ResultCache`](#better-local-and-online-caching)
- [Support for multimodal evaluation](#multimodal-input-format)
- [Unified Retrieval, Reranking and instruction variants](#unified-retrieval-reranking-and-instruction-variants)
- [Search Interface](#search-interface)
- [New documentation](#new-documentation)
- [Descriptive statistics for all tasks](#descriptive-statistics)
- [Better support for error analysis, allowing you to save predictions](#saving-predictions)
- [Support datasets v4](#support-datasets-v4)
- Standardization of file names and typing across the library
- Consistent logging and progress bars
- [Upgrading from v1](#upgrading-from-v1)
  - [Replacing `mteb.MTEB`](#replacing-mtebmteb)
  - [Replacing `mteb.load_results()`](#replacing-mtebload_results)
  - [Converting model to new format](#converting-model-to-new-format)
  - [Reuploading datasets](#reuploading-datasets)

What are the reason for the changes? Generally the many inconsistencies in the library made it hard to maintain without introducing breaking changes and we do think that there is multiple import areas to expand in, e.g. [adding new benchmark for image embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10471), support new model types in general making the library more accessible.
We have already been able to add many new feature in v2.0, but hope that this new version allow us to keep doing so without breaking backward compatibility. See [upgrading from v1](#upgrading-from-v1) for specific deprecations and how to fix them.


### Easier evaluation

Evaluations are now a lot easier using [`mteb.evaluate`][mteb.evaluate.evaluate],

```py
results = mteb.evaluate(model, tasks)
```

### Better local and online caching
The new `mteb.ResultCache` makes managing the cache notably easier:
```py
from mteb.cache import ResultCache

model = ...
tasks = ...

cache = ResultCache(cache_path="~/.cache/mteb") # default

# simple evaluate with cache
results = mteb.evaluate(model, tasks, cache=cache) # only runs if results not in cache
```

It allow you to access the online cache so you don't have to rerun existing models.

```py
# no need to rerun already public results
cache.download_from_remote() # download the latest results from the remote repository
results = mteb.evaluate(model, tasks, cache=cache)
```

### Multimodal Input format

Models in mteb who implements the [`Encoder`][mteb.models.Encoder] protocol now supports multimodal input With the model protocol roughly looking like so:

```py
class Encoder(Protocol): # simplified
    """The interface for an encoder in MTEB."""

    def encode(self, inputs: DataLoader[BatchedInput], ...) -> Array: ...
```

Also, we've introduced a new [`CrossEncoderProtocol`][mteb.models.CrossEncoderProtocol] for cross-encoders and now all cross-encoders have better support for future evaluation:

```python

class CrossEncoderProtocol(Protocol):
    def predict(
        self,
        inputs1: DataLoader[BatchedInput],
        inputs2: DataLoader[BatchedInput],
        ...
    ) -> Array:
```

Not only does this allow more efficient loading using the torch dataloader, but it also allows keys for multiple modalities:

```py
batch_input: BatchedInput = {
    text: list[str],
    images: list[images],
    audio: list[list[audio]], # upcoming
    # + optional fields such as document title
}
```

Where `text` is a batch of texts and `list[images]` is a batch for that texts. This e.g. allows markdown documents with multiple figures like so:

> As you see in the following figure [figure 1](image_1) there is a correlation between A and B.

!!! Note
    More examples of new multimodal inputs you can find in [BatchedInput][mteb.types._encoder_io.BatchedInput] documentation.

However, this also allows no text, multi-image inputs (e.g. for PDFs). Overall this greatly expands the possible tasks that can now be evaluated in MTEB.
To see how to convert a legacy model see the [converting model](#converting-model-to-new-format) section.

### Unified Retrieval, Reranking and instruction variants

The retrieval tasks in MTEB now supports both retrieval and reranking using the same base task. The main difference now that Reranking tasks should have `top_ranked` subset to be evaluated on.
New structure of retrieval tasks: `dataset[subset][split]` = [RetrievalSplitData][mteb.abstasks.retrieval_dataset_loaders.RetrievalSplitData]. On HF this dataset should these subsets:

1. `Corpus` - the corpus to retrieve from. Monolingual name: `corpus`, multilingual name: `{subset}-corpus`. Can contain columns:
   1. `id`, `text`, `title` for text corpus
   2. `id`, `image`, (`text` optionally) for image or multimodal corpus
2. `Queries` - the queries to retrieve with. Monolingual name: `queries`, multilingual name: `{subset}-queries`.
   1. `id`, `text` for text queries. Where text can be str for single query or `list[str]` or [`Conversation`][mteb.types._encoder_io.ConversationTurn] for multi-turn dialogs queries.
   2. `id`, `text`, `instructions` for instruction retrieval/reranking tasks
   3. `id`, `image`, (`text` optionally) for image or multimodal queries
3. `Qrels` - the relevance judgements. Monolingual name: `qrels`, multilingual name: `{subset}-qrels`.
      `query-id`, `corpus-id`, `score` (int or float) for relevance judgements.
4. `Top Ranked` - the top ranked documents to rerank. Only for reranking tasks. Monolingual name: `top_ranked`, multilingual name: `{subset}-top_ranked`.
      `query-id`, `corpus-ids` (`list[str]`) - the top ranked documents for each query.

### Search Interface

To make it easier to use MTEB for search, we have added a simple search interface using the new [`SearchProtocol`][mteb.models.SearchProtocol]:

```py
class SearchProtocol(Protocol):
    """Interface for searching models."""

    def index(
        self,
        corpus: CorpusDatasetType,
        *,
        task_metadata: TaskMetadata,
        hf_split: str,
        hf_subset: str,
        encode_kwargs: dict[str, Any],
    ) -> None:
        ...

    def search(
        self,
        queries: QueryDatasetType,
        *,
        task_metadata: TaskMetadata,
        hf_split: str,
        hf_subset: str,
        top_k: int,
        encode_kwargs: dict[str, Any],
        top_ranked: TopRankedDocumentsType | None = None,
    ) -> RetrievalOutputType:
        ...
```

We're automatically wrapping `Encoder` and `CrossEncoder` models support `SearchProtocol`. However, if your model needs a custom index you can implement this protocol directly, like was done for colbert-like models. <!-- [colbert-like models][mteb.models.model_implementations.pylate_models.PylateSearchEncoder]. -->

### New Documentation

We've added a lot of new documentation to make it easier to get started with MTEB.

- You can see api of our models in tasks in [API documentation](./api/index.md).
- We've added a [getting started guide](./usage/get_started.md) to help you get started with MTEB.
- You can see implemented [tasks](./overview/available_tasks/retrieval.md) and [models](./overview/available_models/text.md) in MTEB.

### Better support for loading and comparing results

The new `ResultCache` also makes it easier to load, inspect and compare both local and online results:

```py
from mteb.cache import ResultCache

cache = ResultCache(cache_path="~/.cache/mteb") # default
cache.download_from_remote() # download the latest results from the remote repository

# load both local and online results
results = cache.load_results(models=["sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2", ...], tasks=["STS12"])
df = results.to_dataframe()
```

### Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics isn't a new thing in MTEB, however, now it is there for every task, to extract it simply run:

```py
import mteb
task = mteb.get_task("MIRACLRetrievalHardNegatives")

task.metadata.descriptive_stats
```

And you will get a highly detailed set of descriptive statistics covering everything from number of samples query lengths, duplicates, etc. These not only make it easier for you to examine tasks, but it also make it easier for us to make quality checks on future tasks.

Example for reranking task:
```json
{
    "test": {
        "num_samples": 160,
        "number_of_characters": 310133,
        "documents_text_statistics": {
            "total_text_length": 307938,
            "min_text_length": 0,
            "average_text_length": 2199.557142857143,
            "max_text_length": 2710,
            "unique_texts": 140
        },
        "documents_image_statistics": null,
        "queries_text_statistics": {
            "total_text_length": 2195,
            "min_text_length": 55,
            "average_text_length": 109.75,
            "max_text_length": 278,
            "unique_texts": 20
        },
        "queries_image_statistics": null,
        "relevant_docs_statistics": {
            "num_relevant_docs": 60,
            "min_relevant_docs_per_query": 7,
            "average_relevant_docs_per_query": 3.0,
            "max_relevant_docs_per_query": 7,
            "unique_relevant_docs": 140
        },
        "top_ranked_statistics": {
            "num_top_ranked": 140,
            "min_top_ranked_per_query": 7,
            "average_top_ranked_per_query": 7.0,
            "max_top_ranked_per_query": 7
        }
    }
}
```

### Saving Predictions

To support error analysis it is now possible to save the model prediction on a given task. You can do this simply as follows:
```python
import mteb

# using a small model and small dataset
encoder = mteb.get_model("sentence-transformers/static-similarity-mrl-multilingual-v1")
task = mteb.get_task("NanoArguAnaRetrieval")

prediction_folder = "path/to/model_predictions"

res = mteb.evaluate(
    encoder,
    task,
    prediction_folder=prediction_folder,
)
```

Result of prediction will be saved in `path/to/model_predictions/{task_name}_predictions.json` and will look like so for retrieval tasks:

```json
{
  "test": {
        "query1": {"document1": 0.77, "document2": 0.12, ...},
        "query2": {"document2": 0.87, "document1": 0.32, ...},
        ...
    }
}
```

### Support datasets v4

With the new functionality for [reuploading datasets][mteb.abstasks.abstask.AbsTask.push_dataset_to_hub] to the standard datasets Parquet format, weâ€™ve reuploaded all tasks with `trust_remote_code`, and MTEB now fully supports Datasets v4.

## Upgrading from v1

This section gives an introduction of how to upgrade from v1 to v2.

### Replacing `mteb.MTEB`

The previous approach to evaluate would require you to first create `MTEB` object and then call `.run` on that object.
The `MTEB` object was initially a sort of catch all object intended for both filtering tasks, selecting tasks, evaluating and few other cases.

This overload of functionality made it hard to change. We have already for a while made it easier to filter and select tasks using `get_tasks` and
`mteb.evaluate` now superseeded `MTEB` as the method for evaluation.

```py
# Approach before 2.0.0:
eval = mteb.MTEB(tasks=tasks) # now throw a deprecation warning
results = eval.run(
    model,
    overwrite=True,
    encode_kwargs={},
    ...
)

# Recommended:
mteb.evaluate(
    model,
    tasks,
    overwrite_strategy="only-missing", # only rerun missing splits
    encode_kwargs={},
    ...
)
```

### Replacing `mteb.load_results()`

Given the new `ResultCache` makes dealing with a results from _both_ local and online caches a lot easier, it can now replace `mteb.load_results` it

```py
tasks = mteb.get_tasks(tasks=["STS12"])
model_names = ["intfloat/multilingual-e5-large"]

# Approach before 2.0.0:
results = mteb.load_results(models=model_names, tasks=tasks, download_latest=True)

# Recommended:
cache = ResultCache("~/.cache/mteb") # default
cache.download_from_remote() # downloads remote results

results = cache.load_results(models=model_names, tasks=tasks)
```


### Converting model to new format

As mentioned in [the above section](#multimodal-input-format) MTEB v2, now supports multimodal input as the default.
Luckily for you all models implemented in MTEB already supports this new format! However, if you have a local model that you would like to evaluate
Here is a quick conversion guide. If you previous implementation looks like so:

```py
# v1.X.X
class MyDummyEncoder:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        self.model = ...

    def encode(self, sentences: list[str], **kwargs) -> Array:
        embeddings = self.model.encode(sentences)
        return embeddings
```

You can simply unpack it to its text input like so:

```py
# v2.0.0
class MyDummyEncoder:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        self.model = ...

    def encode(self, input: DataLoader[BatchedInput], **kwargs) -> Array:
        # unpack to v1 format:
        sentences = [text for batch in inputs for text in batch["text"]]
        # do as you did beforehand:
        embeddings = self.model.encode(sentences)
        return embeddings
```

Of course, it will be more efficient if work directly with the dataloader.

### Reuploading datasets

If your dataset is in old format, or you want to reupload it to the new Parquet format, you can do so using the new
[`push_dataset_to_hub`][mteb.abstasks.abstask.AbsTask.push_dataset_to_hub] method:

```py
import mteb

task = mteb.get_task("MyOldTask")
task.push_dataset_to_hub("my-username/my-new-task")
```

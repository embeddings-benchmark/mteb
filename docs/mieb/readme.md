# Welcome to MIEB! ðŸ‘‹

The [Massive Image Embedding Benchmark (MIEB)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10471) is an image extension of [MTEB](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07316) to cover embedding tasks for image-text tasks.

## ðŸŒ± Background

MIEB intends to extend MTEB and MMTEB to cover image representation learning and image-text alignment tasks. At the time of publishing, MIEB offers 130 tasks over 8 task categories. 3 benchmarks are offered:
1. `MIEB(Multilingual)`
2. `MIEB(eng)`
3. `MIEB(lite)`

## ðŸš€ Running MIEB

If youâ€™re already familiar with how MTEB works, then run any benchmark, task, and model the same way! 


### Run MIEB in 2 lines via CLI
First, install the `mieb` dependencies:
```sh
pip install mteb[image]
```

Then, run the multilingual benchmark with a selected model, e.g. CLIP:
```sh
mteb run -b â€˜MIEB(Multilingual)â€™ -m openai/clip-vit-base-patch16
```

### Run MIEB in Python

Similarly, running the benchmark can be done in Python in 3 main steps: 1) Select the tasks, load the model, and run the evaluation.

1. Select the whole benchmark
```python
import mteb

tasks = mteb.get_benchmarks("MIEB(Multilingual)")
```

Alternatively, select a single task:
```python
tasks = mteb.get_tasks(tasks=["CIFAR10ZeroShot"])
```

Or select tasks by categories:
```python
tasks = mteb.get_tasks(task_types=["Compositionality"])
```

2. Load a Model: 

```python
model_name = "laion/CLIP-ViT-L-14-laion2B-s32B-b82K"
model = mteb.get_model(model_name=model_name)
```

3. Run the Evaluation: 

```python
evaluation = mteb.MTEB(tasks=tasks)
results = evaluation.run(model)
```


## ðŸª´ Contributing to MIEB

The FIRST step is to _always_ create an issue in the MTEB repo (this one), and add the `mieb` label. PRs without issues will not be accepted.

There are a few ways for anyone to contribute to MIEB:

  1. Add a dataset as an existing task type. This means that the `AbsTask` already exists, e.g. `AbsTaskImageClassification`, and the effort is solely in adding an instance of it.
  2.  Add a model. This could mean either: a) The model wrapper, e.g. `OpenCLIPWrapper`, already exists, and the effort is solely in adding a filled out `ModelMeta` object, and/or b) Add a new model wrapper.
  3. Add a new task type. This means that the existing task types do not cover this new task. An accompanying evaluator should also be implemented.

Let's go through an example.

### Example

Here is an example implementing a zero-shot image classification from scratch. Let's say we wish to implement CIFAR10 as a task and evaluate an OpenCLIP model on it.

To solve this task, we need to encode the `images`, encode the `class label candidates with prompts` (e.g. "this is a dog pic", "this is a cat pic"), and compare them by calculating similarity, and then argmax out the class prediction for each image. We begin by implementing a model wrapper.

#### Model Wrapper
See the [`ImageEncoder` class](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb/blob/mieb/mteb/encoder_interface.py) for more details. The model class implements `get_text_embeddings`, `get_image_embeddings`, and `calculate_probs` methods.
As an example,  [`OpenCLIPWrapper`](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb/blob/mieb/mteb/models/openclip_models.py) is first implemented, with metadata defined below.
```python
class OpenCLIPWrapper:
    ...
```
See also [adding a model](adding_a_model.md) for reference.

#### X Evaluator
With the model, [ZeroShotClassificationEvaluator](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb/blob/mieb/mteb/evaluation/evaluators/Image/ZeroShotClassificationEvaluator.py) is implemented here. This defines how the model are used to do zero-shot classification and get back results on desired metrics.
```python
class ZeroShotClassificationEvaluator(Evaluator):
    def __init__(self, ...):
        ...
    def __call__(self, model: Encoder, *, encode_kwargs: dict[str, Any] = {}):
        """Get embeddings and calculate scores."""
        ...
```

#### AbsTask X
With the evaluator, [AbsTaskZeroShotClassification](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb/blob/mieb/mteb/abstasks/Image/AbsTaskZeroShotClassification.py) is defined, operating on the dataset, calling the defined Evaluator, and gives out results.
```python
class AbsTaskZeroShotClassification(AbsTask):
    ...
```


#### Dataset class
With all these, we can then define the dataset. [CIFAR10](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb/blob/mieb/mteb/tasks/Image/ZeroShotClassification/eng/CIFAR.py) is implemented like this, subclassing `AbsTaskZeroShotClassification`, and overwrite the `get_candidate_labels` function, which gives `["a photo of {label_name}"]` to be used in the evaluator.
```python
class CIFAR10ZeroShotClassification(AbsTaskZeroShotClassification):
    metadata = TaskMetadata(...)

    def get_candidate_labels(self) -> list[str]:
        ...
```
See also [adding a dataset](adding_a_dataset.md) for reference.

#### Putting them all together
With all these, we can then
```python
import mteb

model_name = "laion/CLIP-ViT-L-14-laion2B-s32B-b82K"
model = mteb.get_model(model_name=model_name)

tasks = mteb.get_tasks(tasks=["CIFAR10ZeroShot"])
evaluation = mteb.MTEB(tasks=tasks)
results = evaluation.run(model)
```

By default, results will be under `results/laion__CLIP-ViT-L-14-laion2B-s32B-b82K/REVISION/CIFAR10ZeroShot.json`. Sometimes metrics can be a bit different than what the original paper claimed. This might be due to the resolution/layout difference of images in the remake of the dataset.

# Getting Started

## Installation

You can install `mteb` using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/) simply by running:

```bash
pip install mteb
```

??? tip "Model Specific Installations"

    If you want to run certain models implemented within mteb you will often need some additional dependencies. These can be installed using:

    ```bash
    pip install mteb[openai]
    ```

    If a specific mdel requires a dependency it will raise an error with the recommended installation. To get an overview of the implemented models see [here](missing).

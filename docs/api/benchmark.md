# Benchmark

A benchmark within `mteb` is essentially just a list of tasks along with some metadata about the benchmark.


<figure markdown="span">
    ![](../images/visualizations/benchmark_explainer.png){ width="80%" }
    <figcaption>An overview of the benchmark within `mteb`</figcaption>
</figure>

This metadata includes a short description of the benchmark's intention, the reference, and the citation. If you use a benchmark from `mteb`, we recommend that you cite it along with `mteb`.

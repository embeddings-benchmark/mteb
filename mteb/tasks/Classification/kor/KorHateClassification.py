        toxic speech detection from a Korean online entertainment news aggregator. Recently,
        two young Korean celebrities suffered from a series of tragic incidents that led to two
        major Korean web portals to close the comments section on their platform. However, this only
        serves as a temporary solution, and the fundamental issue has not been solved yet. This dataset
        hopes to improve Korean hate speech detection. Annotation was performed by 32 annotators,
        consisting of 29 annotators from the crowdsourcing platform DeepNatural AI and three NLP researchers.

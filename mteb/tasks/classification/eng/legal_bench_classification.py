The task is to classify whether the excerpt includes the outcome of the appeal, and if so, to specify whether the appeal was allowed or dismissed. Partial success (e.g. appeal granted on one tax year but dismissed on another) counts as allowed (with the exception of costs orders which are disregarded). Where the excerpt does not clearly articulate an outcome, the system should indicate other as the outcome. Categorizing case outcomes is a common task that legal researchers complete in order to gather datasets involving outcomes in legal processes for the purposes of quantitative empirical legal research.",
